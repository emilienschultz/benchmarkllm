''his status as a torah sage gave him political power, and made him an important political force,'' said menachem friedman, an expert on religious politics at bar-ilan university. rabbi shach preached moderation in the arab-israeli conflict, but voiced harsh criticism of secular israelis, whom he described as hopelessly alienated from their faith. he called israeli settlements in the west bank and gaza strip ''a blatant attempt to provoke the international community'' that endangered jewish lives, and he supported israeli withdrawals from those territories to prevent further bloodshed. but he was uncompromising in his opposition to the liberal values of secular israeli society, a stance that put him at odds with the left-leaning labor party. in 1990, rabbi schach thwarted an attempt by shimon peres, the labor party leader, to withdraw from the government of the rightist prime minister yitzhak shamir and replace it with a narrow coalition with strictly orthodox parties. accusing the labor party of abandoning its jewish heritage, rabbi schach withheld the support of the degel hatorah party, whose participation was crucial for the formation of a governing coalition headed by mr. peres. in a widely quoted speech in tel aviv, rabbi shach inveighed against labor, saying that the party had ''severed the past from the jewish people.'' ''today you can meet children who don't know what the sabbath is,'' he said. ''there are kibbutzes that don't know what yom kippur is -- no idea.'' ''and, they raise rabbits and pigs there,'' he added, referring to animals whose consumption is forbidden under jewish dietary laws. ''and this is called the jewish people?'' in 1996, when mr. peres ran for prime minister against benjamin netanyahu, rabbi schach called on his legions of followers to vote for mr. netanyahu, making a crucial contribution to his narrow victory. in the 1980's and early 90's, rabbi shach waged a campaign against the hassidic lubavitcher movement after it asserted that its leader, rabbi menachem mendel schneerson, was the messiah. the messianic claim, rabbi schach said, was ''total heresy,'' adding that those making it ''will burn in hell.'' rabbi schach's stance caused a rift in his agudat yisrael party. when the party newspaper published lubavitcher writings, rabbi shach formed a competing newspaper. eventually he established degel hatorah as a breakaway party. but the two groups joined forces in 1992 in a bloc named united torah judaism. politically inactive since 1996, rabbi schach was in deteriorating health in recent years, and as he lay near death this week, thousands of his followers prayed for his survival. ''when his soul left him, we all cried out, wept,'' moshe gafni, a lawmaker from united torah judaism, said in a radio interview today.

Obituary title: ernest medina, army captain acquitted in my lai massacre, dies at 81
Obituary:
ernest l. medina, the army captain who was accused of overall responsibility for the march 1968 mass killings of unarmed south vietnamese men, women and children by troops he commanded in what became known as the my lai massacre, but was acquitted at a court-martial, died on tuesday in peshtigo, wis. he was 81. his death was confirmed by the thielen funeral home in marinette, a nearby town where he had lived. the cause was not given. on march 16, 1968, a month and a half after north vietnamese and vietcong forces launched the tet offensive, wide-ranging attacks that stunned the american military command in the vietnam war, captain medina and the three platoons of his infantry company entered the village of my lai in south vietnam’s south central coast region. what happened over the hours that followed became one of darkest chapters of american military history. an army inquiry ultimately determined that 347 civilians were killed that day — shot, bayoneted or blasted with grenades. a vietnamese memorial erected at the site has put the toll at 504. but the mass killings were not exposed until november 1969, when the independent journalist seymour hersh, tipped off to the atrocity, wrote of it in a series of articles that brought him a pulitzer prize for international reporting. the revelations were shocking in an america already divided over an increasingly unpopular war. but captain medina and lieutenant william l. calley jr., who was subsequently convicted of murder at a court-martial as the leader of the platoon that carried out the massacre, came to be viewed by many as scapegoats in an unwinnable conflict. captain medina and his men of charlie company, a unit in the 11th brigade of the americal division, engaged in “search and destroy operations” in march 1968 aimed at clearing the vietcong from populated areas where they were presumed to have taken refuge. according to captain medina’s later testimony at lieutenant calley’s court-martial, army intelligence had advised that the villagers of my lai (pronounced me-lye) would be doing their customary shopping at a nearby marketplace when the troops arrived. those left in the village at that hour would supposedly be vietcong soldiers who had blended in with the population. the intelligence was faulty. while captain medina remained near his helicopter’s landing spot a few hundred yards outside of my lai, keeping in radio contact with his men, lieutenant calley, an inexperienced officer, and his equally green infantrymen rampaged through the village, encountering only unarmed civilians. the massacre that unfolded did not conclude until a helicopter pilot, chief warrant officer hugh thompson jr., hovering with two crewmen to identify enemy positions by drawing expected vietcong fire, saw signs of mass killings, landed in the village, demanded at gunpoint that lieutenant calley halt the attack and alerted higher authorities by radio. lieutenant calley was convicted of premeditated murder of least 22 civilians at a lengthy court-martial ending in march 1971. he testified that captain medina had ordered him via radio to “get rid of” what the lieutenant had described as “enemy personnel” whose detention was slowing his progress through the village. captain medina denied that the conversation took place and his testimony was corroborated by his radio officer. he testified that in his pre-assault briefing, he had not generally addressed the issue of what to do with civilians in the village since he assumed everyone there would be vietcong. but he testified that when one his troopers asked, “do we kill women and children?” he replied: “no, you do not kill women and children. you must use common sense,” adding that “if they have a weapon and are trying to engage you, then you can shoot back.” lieutenant calley was sentenced to 20 years in prison but the case became embroiled in court battles and he spent a little more than three years confined to barracks or under house arrest at fort benning, ga., before being released. captain medina went on trial in september 1971, defended by the prominent criminal lawyer f. lee bailey, as well as a military lawyer. he was charged with involuntary manslaughter of at least 100 civilians, the murder of a woman and two counts of assault against a prisoner by firing twice over his head to frighten him the night after the massacre. the defense contended that captain medina was unaware of large-scale killings of defenseless civilians until they had already occurred. the prosecution argued that the defense account was not credible since captain medina had been in continual radio contact with his platoons. the court-martial panel of five combat officers returned not guilty verdicts on all counts after an hour’s deliberation. following revelations of the massacre in the news media, the army undertook an official investigation. lt. gen. william r. peers, who oversaw it, declared on march 18, 1970, “our inquiry clearly established that a tragedy of major proportions occurred there on that day.” lieutenant calley was the only soldier convicted on criminal charges in connection with the massacre. maj. gen. samuel w. koster , the commander of the americal division, was found by an army inquiry to have failed to investigate reports of the mass killings adequately. he was demoted one rank, to brigadier general. col. oran henderson , a brigade commander in the division, stood trial and was acquitted of cover-up charges. both had hovered above my lai in their helicopters during the massacre but maintained they had been unaware of mass murders. ernest lou medina was born on aug. 27, 1936, in springer, n.m., one of two children of simon medina, a ranch hand, and his wife, pauline. his mother died of cancer when he was an infant and his father sent him and his sister to live with grandparents in montrose, colo., while pursuing work as a sheepherder. after graduating from high school he enlisted in the army as a private in 1956. he later attended officer candidate school, was commissioned as a lieutenant and arrived in vietnam in december 1967. in the weeks before my lai, lieutenant calley’s platoon had suffered casualties when his men wandered into a minefield. captain medina rescued survivors, an act for which he was later awarded a silver star. mr. medina and mr. calley both resigned from the army after their court-martials. mr. medina settled with his family in marinette and worked as a salesman for a helicopter company and a real estate agent. mr. calley joined a family jewelry business in georgia. mr. medina’s survivors include his wife, barbara; his sons greg and cecil and a daughter, ingrid medina; his sister, linda lovato, and eight grandchildren. in an interview with the associated press in 1988, mr. medina called the my lai killings a “horrendous thing.” “i have regrets for it, but i have no guilt over it because i didn’t cause it,” he said. “that’s not what the military, particularly the united states army, is trained for.” he said that the my lai killings needed to be viewed in the context of the vietnam war. “there were no front lines,” he said. “it was a guerrilla war. it’s something i feel a lot of draftees were not trained for, a lot of the officers were not trained. i’m talking not just about lieutenants. i’m talking about senior officers.” “but then again, maybe the war should have never happened,” he added. “i think if everybody were to look at it in hindsight, i’m sure a lot of the politicians and generals would think of it otherwise. maybe it was a war that we should have probably never gotten involved in as deeply as we did without the will to win it.” credit: richard

“that’s not what the military, particularly the united states army, is trained for.” he said that the my lai killings needed to be viewed in the context of the vietnam war. “there were no front lines,” he said. “it was a guerrilla war. it’s something i feel a lot of draftees were not trained for, a lot of the officers were not trained. i’m talking not just about lieutenants. i’m talking about senior officers.” “but then again, maybe the war should have never happened,” he added. “i think if everybody were to look at it in hindsight, i’m sure a lot of the politicians and generals would think of it otherwise. maybe it was a war that we should have probably never gotten involved in as deeply as we did without the will to win it.” credit: richard goldstein"

as a struggling literary agent in london, he took a chance on j.k. rowling and harry potter, turning her books into the most lucrative literary franchise in history.christopher little, who as a struggling literary agent took a chance on a scrappy submission about tween-age wizards -- even though he once disdained children's fiction as a money-loser -- and built it into the most successful literary empire in history on the strength of its lead character, harry potter, died on jan. 7 at his home in london. he was 79.his death, from cancer, was announced by his firm, the christopher little literary agency.j.k. rowling, the author of the harry potter series, was an unpublished, unemployed single mother in edinburgh in 1995 when she sent mr. little the first three chapters of her first book after finding his name in a directory of literary agents. knowing nothing about the business, she picked him because his name made him sound like a character from a children's book.mr. little submitted the manuscript for ""harry potter and the philosopher's stone"" to 12 publishers. he received 12 rejections in response, before selling it for £2,500, or about $3,400 (the equivalent of about $5,800 today). it was a meager amount, but his genius was in the details: he sold only the rights to publish it in britain and the commonwealth, and he asked for high royalties.it was the beginning of what one british newspaper called ""the most commercially successful relationship in literary history."" the book was a hit in britain, and mr. little sold the u.s. rights for just over $100,000 and, soon after that, the film rights for $1.8 million.mr. little did more than launch ms. rowling's career. he was the architect of the entertainment powerhouse that grew up around harry potter, helping line up everything from legos to amusement parks.ms. rowling was the first author to earn more than $1 billion off her work, and it's no surprise that her agent did well too: by some estimates mr. little made over $60 million from the harry potter franchise. he never claimed credit for her success, but he was ever-present in the background, appearing alongside his client at book launches and movie premieres, enjoying those brief moments in the limelight.the relationship was not to last. in 2011 ms. rowling abruptly split with mr. little, opting to follow his in-house lawyer, neil blair, who had left to establish his own agency. mr. little, shocked, threatened to sue, but he backed off after ms. rowling paid him an undisclosed sum.""christopher little was the first person in the publishing industry to believe in me,"" ms. rowling said in a statement after his death. ""being taken on by his agency was a huge break for an unknown writer. he represented me throughout the 10 years i published harry potter and, in doing so, changed my life.""christopher john little was born on oct. 10, 1941, in york, in northeastern england, and grew up in liversedge, a small town between manchester and leeds. his father, bernard, flew spitfires for the royal air force in the battle of britain during world war ii and became an officer of the order of the british empire. he later became a coroner. his mother, nancy (pickersgill) little, was a secretary.mr. little's first marriage, to linda frewen, ended in divorce. they had two sons, nicholas and kim, who survive him, as do two grandchildren and his second wife, gilly, whom he married in 2012.mr. little left school at 16 to work for his uncle's textile firm. he later worked for another textile company in france, and from 1965 to 1974 lived in hong kong and other asian cities. he sold office supplies, worsted wool cloth and, eventually, mutual funds, developing a reputation as a steely negotiator. after returning to england, he opened a recruiting firm.in 1979 philip nicholson, a childhood friend who had also lived in hong kong and knew something of mr. little's deal-making skills, asked him to help sell his first novel, a thriller he had written under the pen name a.j. quinnell. the book, ""man on fire,"" went on to sell 7.5 million copies and was twice adapted for film, most recently in 2004, with denzel washington in the lead.flush with his early success, mr. little opened the christopher little literary agency, though he maintained that selling manuscripts was just a ""hobby."" it soon became more than that -- in 1992, with a stable of about 20 writers, he shut down his recruiting business.but he struggled to replicate that first win. his office near victoria station, in central london, was cramped with towering piles of manuscripts. one of his writers called it ""near-dickensian.""mr. little, who preferred to pursue thrillers and romance novels, initially dismissed ms. rowling's submission, throwing it away without reading it. but its elaborate binding caught the eye of his office manager, bryony evens, who read it and, intrigued, insisted he give it a chance. like her, he was immediately taken with the tale of wizards and muggles, of dumbledore and hermione and he who must not be named.an intensely private man, mr. little rarely gave interviews. but in a conversation with the sunday telegraph in 2003, he said, ""i thought that there was something really special there, although we could never have guessed what would happen to it.""without the money to print the usual 10 copies that publishers expected with each submission, he had ms. evens retrieve the manuscripts after they were rejected, so he could send them back out.he finally persuaded bloomsbury to take on the book, helped along by the young daughter of its publisher, who loved it. the initial print run was just 500 copies. but mr. little refused to push further, for foreign or film rights; by this point, he knew it would be a success, and he wanted the hype to build before negotiating.""we had to wait two years, but it worked. we got the reviews and the word of mouth,"" he told the telegraph.

  ""RESPONSE"": 2021 - 1955 = 66, 66 - 65 = 1. However, since the obituary states that he died at the age of 65, we can infer that he was 65 years old at the time of his death. Therefore, the response is 65.",not mentioned,"{

Obituary title: daniel wolf, 65, dies; helped create a market for art photography
Obituary:
in 1984, he quietly amassed 25,000 photos for the j. paul getty museum, jump-starting collectors’ interest in the medium. daniel wolf pulled off what may have been the greatest legal art caper of all time: over the course of two years in the early 1980s, he quietly amassed some 25,000 classic and contemporary photographs, buying them from the world’s most renowned collectors on behalf of his client the j. paul getty museum in los angeles. he was so secretive that none of the sellers knew about the others, or about their buyer — a stealthiness that allowed him, and the getty, to pay about $17 million, “less than the price of a moderately good cezanne still life,” said john walsh, the director of the getty at the time, in an interview with the los angeles times. when the collection was announced in july 1984, it transformed the museum, until then best known for its antiquities holdings, into a leading center for photography — and it signaled that the medium, often overlooked by the art market, would be given equal standing alongside painting and sculpture. “the getty acquisition sounded the starting bell of a golden age of great public photography collecting,” said peter galassi, a former chief curator of photography at the museum of modern art. mr. wolf was only 27 when he began his quest, but he was already one of the leading figures in the photography market. his gallery on west 57th street offered an eclectic but always astounding array of classic and contemporary works, which he displayed in a prodigious 100 shows over the gallery’s nine-year career. the gallery was more than a place to buy art. it was a social hub, where photographers, museum curators, dealers and clients could rub shoulders, creating a community and a common language around the emerging market for photographs. “i was filled with a certain kind of awe, getting to be in that space,” said the photographer gregory crewdson, who interned for mr. wolf in 1983. “photography didn’t have the same kind of importance as other art forms. his gallery and his presence and his commitment changed that. it legitimated photography.” mr. wolf was 65 when he died on jan. 25 at his home in ridgway, colo. his wife, the artist maya lin, said the cause was a heart attack. though he made his name as an art dealer, mr. wolf was at his core a collector, not just of photographs but of whatever caught his eye: he built significant collections of pre-columbian american art, chinese ceramics and frank lloyd wright furniture. his home in colorado was filled with gems and minerals, some of which he found himself in the surrounding mountains; others he bought during his annual pilgrimage to the tucson gem and mineral show, one of the world’s largest. some of his collections were for other people; after closing his gallery in 1987, he worked mostly for private clients. but others were just for him, an abundance of treasure that he squirreled away in storage units throughout new york city. he and ms. lin bought a shuttered city jail in yonkers in 2014 to house his collections, and he was still unpacking when he died. “there is a fine line between collector and hoarder, but he didn’t care,” ms. lin said in an interview. “he could find the beauty in something the rest of us would be running away from saying, ‘that is so weird.’” mark daniel wolf was born on march 29, 1955, in cheyenne, wyo., and raised in denver, igniting a lifetime love for the colorado rocky mountains. his father, erving, had risen from poverty to make a fortune buying and selling oil rights around the west. his mother, joyce (mandel) wolf, was a homemaker. along with his wife and mother, mr. wolf is survived by his daughters, india and rachel, and his brother, mathew. he attended phillips exeter academy in new hampshire and bennington college in vermont. though he primarily studied painting, he was heavily influenced by classes he took with the photographer minor white and by family trips to europe, where he discovered troves of old photographs at parisian flea markets. on weekends during college, he would travel to manhattan with a suitcase full of some of those old photographs, which he would sell on the sidewalk outside the metropolitan museum of art. he didn’t need the money — his parents’ upper east side home was just three blocks away — but he was determined to cut his own path, ms. lin said. he opened the daniel wolf gallery in 1977, one of just a handful of dealers in photography in the city. the market for art photography was only beginning to emerge, which meant that mr. wolf, with his keen eye and preternatural sense for the next big thing, was able to build one of the best collections in the world. he became a habitué of london art auctions, at the time the center for photo collectors. there he bonded with other dealers and collectors, like sam wagstaff, who later sold his collection of 2,500 photos to mr. wolf as part of the getty acquisition. back home, mr. wolf devised innovative ways to win over art collectors to photography. a two-part show, “photographs by” and “photographs in,” featured photographs by famous artists, from edgar degas to sol lewitt, as well as works by artists like andy warhol and ed ruscha that incorporated photographs. but nothing made quite as big a splash as the getty acquisition. it not only gave an institutional imprimatur to collecting photography; it also soaked up a sizable chunk of supply, making the remaining works on the market much more valuable. “suddenly, absolutely overnight, 25,000 of the rarest photographs ever taken were off the market,” said weston naef, who helped mr. wolf plan the acquisition for the getty and later became its first curator of photography. “it would be like someone removing half the gold from fort knox.” along with steady work for private clients, he also acted as a matchmaker of sorts, especially for young and under-the-radar artists. in 1997 he introduced the organizers of the whitney museum biennial to aaron rose, an immensely talented photographer who was so hermetic that he had never participated in a major show. (he died in february at 84.) mr. wolf lent 10 daguerreotypes by the 19th-century french photographer joseph-philibert girault de prangey in 2019 for a show at the met museum, in front of which he had hawked photos out of a suitcase more than 40 years before. he collected friends as well. by all accounts warm and curious, mr. wolf counted not just artists but musicians, politicians and writers in his circle, including both the diplomat richard holbrooke and the composer john cage. one friend, the italian architect ettore sottsass, designed a home for mr. wolf in colorado. another, merce cunningham, put him on the board of his dance company. he later moved beyond photography into decorative arts, furniture and american painting, a favorite of his parents, who had endowed a gallery at the met dedicated to 19th-century american art. he co-produced a 2006 documentary, “andy warhol,” by ric burns, which won a peabody award. “if one is interested in beauty, in finding beauty, suffering from a sort of obsessive compulsive disorder is a quality,” the painter francesco clemente, a longtime friend of mr. wolf’s, said in a phone interview. “he had that compulsive quality to hunt and search for things.”",2021-03-24,"Date: 2021-03-24

""it was a strained relationship, but it was civil,"" he said. john smith whose death was announced by his family, is survived by his wife, gertrude; a son, terry; a daughter, patricia stiff; a sister, lou wolfe; eight grandchildren; and 19 great-grandchildren. another son, craig, carried on a family obsession. he was attempting to break a speed record on water in 1989 when his jet-powered hydroplane broke up on lake jackson in sebring, fla., killing him. john and his wife were in the crowd. dr. stiff, who visited his grandfather's shop when he was growing up, recalled how ""he took stuff out of junkyards and made a racecar"" and ""could just about fix anything."" and he remembered how his grandfather liked to say, ""there's nothing like sitting in a car and feeling the afterburners."" john smith left, in 1965 with bobby tatroe, who drove the rocket-propelled wingfoot express.

Obituary:
henry pleasants, a music critic and author who doubled as a top american spy in postwar germany, died at a hospital in london on jan. 4. he was 89 and lived in london. a former colleague at the central intelligence agency said mr. pleasants had served as the intelligence agency's station chief in bonn in the 1950's. ''the invisible government,'' a book by david wise and thomas b. ross published in 1964, said he had held the post ''for many years.'' in an interview yesterday, mr. wise said the statement had never been challenged. another book, ''the old boys,'' by burton hersh, published in 1992, also identified mr. pleasants as an american intelligence operative. several journalists who worked in germany said they knew him as the c.i.a. station chief. william harlow, a c.i.a. spokesman, said the agency did not confirm whether individuals had served as station chiefs. mr. pleasants was best known for his books about the voice, which he loved, and contemporary music, about which he became disillusioned in the early 1950's. an earlier version of his obituary, published on wednesday, focused on his career as a music writer and briefly mentioned his spending four years in the united states foreign service, from 1950 to 1954; it did not take account of his c.i.a. activities. his first book, ''the agony of modern music'' (1955), caused considerable controversy with its attacks on all contemporary music except jazz. ''serious music is a dead art,'' he began. ''the vein which for 300 years offered a seemingly inexhaustible yield of beautiful music has run out. what we know as modern music is the noise made by deluded speculators picking through its slag pile.'' the authors of ''the invisible government'' pointed out the oddness of the situation. they said mr. pleasants ''probably had the distinction of being the only top u.s. spy to become the center of a literary storm.'' c.i.a. employees in embassies are often listed in the state department biographic register as ''attaches.'' mr. pleasants was an ''attache'' with ''s-1'' ranking, meaning the highest category of foreign service officer. mr. pleasants did his intelligence work during the cold war, when espionage and intrigue abounded in germany. for some months, according to ''the invisible government,'' he lived with reinhard gehlen, a former nazi general who was being considered as a top intelligence official for west germany, to evaluate his suitability. the gehlen organization, which the former general led, became the forerunner of the postwar west german federal intelligence service. about the same time, mr. pleasants was also writing ''death of a music?'' and ''serious music and all that jazz'' about contemporary music. his books about voice were ''the great singers: from the dawn of opera to our own time,'' a 1966 survey that has become a standard reference work, ''the great american popular singers'' and ''opera in crisis.'' his last book was ''the great tenor tragedy: the last days of adolphe nourrit.'' he was born in wayne, pa., and studied at the philadelphia music academy and the curtis institute of music. he began his writing career as a critic for the philadelphia evening bulletin in 1930, when he was 19. he was the music editor from 1935 to 1942, when he joined the army. after world war ii, he was involved in the de-nazification proceedings against several musicians who were prominently involved in the third reich. it is not clear when mr. pleasants began his service with the c.i.a. records show him joining the foreign service in 1950 and holding various positions in munich, bern and bonn until his retirement in 1954, years in which he also seems to have been with the c.i.a. mr. wise said he remained active with the intelligence agency at least until the early 1960's. from 1945 to 1955, mr. pleasants contributed articles about european music to the new york times. he later became the london editor of stereo review and from 1967 to 1998 was a music critic for the international herald tribune. he is survived by his wife, the harpsichordist virginia pleasants; two sisters, constantia bowditch of peterborough, n.h., and nancy logue of clarksville, tenn.; and a brother, william, of bethel, del. henry pleasants (1974)",2000-01-14,"Date: 2000-01-14

''the vein which for 300 years offered a seemingly inexhaustible yield of beautiful music has run out. what we know as modern music is the noise made by deluded speculators picking through its slag pile.'' the authors of ''the invisible government'' pointed out the oddness of the situation. they said mr. smith ''probably had the distinction of being the only top u.s. spy to become the center of a literary storm.'' c.i.a. employees in embassies are often listed in the state department biographic register as ''attaches.'' mr. smith was an ''attache'' with ''s-1'' ranking, meaning the highest category of foreign service officer. mr. smith did his intelligence work during the cold war, when espionage and intrigue abounded in germany. for some months, according to ''the invisible government,'' he lived with reinhard gehlen, a former nazi general who was being considered as a top intelligence official for west germany, to evaluate his suitability. the gehlen organization, which the former general led, became the forerunner of the postwar west german federal intelligence service. about the same time, mr. smith was also writing ''death of a music?'' and ''serious music and all that jazz'' about contemporary music. his books about voice were ''the great singers: from the dawn of opera to our own time,'' a 1966 survey that has become a standard reference work, ''the great american popular singers'' and ''opera in crisis.'' his last book was ''the great tenor tragedy: the last days of adolphe nourrit.'' he was born in wayne, pa., and studied at the philadelphia music academy and the curtis institute of music. he began his writing career as a critic for the philadelphia evening bulletin in 1930, when he was 19. he was the music editor from 1935 to 1942, when he joined the army. after world war ii, he was involved in the de-nazification proceedings against several musicians who were prominently involved in the third reich. it is not clear when mr. smith began his service with the c.i.a. records show him joining the foreign service in 1950 and holding various positions in munich, bern and bonn until his retirement in 1954, years in which he also seems to have been with the c.i.a. mr. wise said he remained active with the intelligence agency at least until the early 1960's. from 1945 to 1955, mr. smith contributed articles about european music to the new york times. he later became the london editor of stereo review and from 1967 to 1998 was a music critic for the international herald tribune. he is survived by his wife, the harpsichordist virginia smith two sisters, constantia bowditch of peterborough, n.h., and nancy logue of clarksville, tenn.; and a brother, william, of bethel, del. john smith (1974)"

Obituary title: john singleton, ‘boyz n the hood’ director, dies at 51
Obituary:
john singleton, whose powerful debut film, “boyz n the hood,” earned him an oscar nomination for best director, the first for an african-american, died on monday in los angeles. he was 51. his death, at cedars-sinai medical center, was confirmed in a family statement after he was taken off life support. mr. singleton had been admitted to the hospital on april 17, reportedly after having a stroke. his family said he had a history of hypertension. his mother, shelia ward, said last week that he was in a coma and filed court papers asking to be appointed his temporary conservator. several of his children at the time opposed her trying to take control of his medical and financial decision making and publicly disputed her assessment of his medical state. “boyz n the hood,” a bleakly realistic film about three teenagers growing up amid gang violence in south-central los angeles, established mr. singleton’s credentials and placed him in the conversation with more established african-american directors like spike lee, bill duke, julie dash, robert townsend and reginald hudlin. “when i was 18, i saw ‘she’s gotta have it,’ ” mr. singleton said, referring to mr. lee’s 1986 breakthrough film, in a youtube video in 2013. “the movie was so powerful to me, as a young black teen who grew up seeing movies with not a lot of people who looked like me.” he was 22 when he began shooting “boyz,” which follows tre (played by cuba gooding jr.) and his friends ricky (morris chestnut) and doughboy (ice cube) as they try to avoid gangs and drugs. when ricky is shot and killed by a gang member, doughboy, his half brother, seeks revenge, but tre backs away from retribution.

at least one person was killed and dozens were wounded around the country. but the movie did strong business, selling more than $123 million in tickets domestically in today’s dollars. mr. singleton lost the 1992 academy award for best director to jonathan demme, who won for “silence of the lambs.” he was also nominated for best original screenplay, but callie khouri won that oscar for “thelma and louise.” mr. singleton remains the youngest oscar nominee for best director. no black filmmaker has won the oscar for best director. but when mr. lee won this year for best adapted screenplay, for “blackkklansman,” mr. singleton was ecstatic. “my brother spike lee just won his first oscar,” mr. singleton wrote on twitter. “i’m sooo happy!” john daniel singleton was born on jan. 6, 1968, in los angeles. his mother was a pharmaceutical sales executive, and his father, danny singleton, was a mortgage broker. he lived with his mother until he was 11 and then moved in with his father, on whom he based the character of tre’s father (played by laurence fishburne) in “boyz.” john was influenced early on by movies like “cooley high” (1975), a comedy-drama about high school friends living in the projects in chicago, directed by michael schultz and starring glynn turman and lawrence hilton-jacobs. mr. singleton was 7 when he saw the film with his mother. he recalled that she cried when mr. hilton-jacobs’s character was killed. “i looked at my mother and i said, ‘why are you crying?,’ ” he said in a 2016 interview with vanity fair. “and she said, ‘because it’s such a good movie.’ so i start thinking, when i get to make a movie, i got to make people cry. i got to make them feel something.” from his mother’s apartment in inglewood he could see films playing at the local drive-in: horror, kung fu, blaxploitation and slasher movies. “the cinema saved me from being a delinquent,” he said. he studied script writing at the university of southern california’s school of film-television and wrote the “boyz n the hood” screenplay during his senior year. he then showed it to stephanie allain, a script reader for two of columbia pictures’ top executives. at the time, he was being interviewed to succeed her. he didn’t get the job, but she loved the script and pushed for it to be acquired. before a deal was made, though, mr. singleton demanded, despite his inexperience, that he direct the film. frank price, the president of columbia, agreed; he was especially impressed with mr. singleton’s audition tapes of mr. gooding and ice cube. mr. singleton returned to south central — the neighborhood is now called south los angeles — in his next film, “poetic justice” (1993), a melodrama centering on a romance between a poet (played by the singer janet jackson) who works as a beautician and a postman (the rapper tupac shakur in an early movie role). in an otherwise lukewarm review of the film, vincent canby of the new york times wrote that mr. singleton had made a significant leap as a storyteller from “boyz n the hood.” “poetic justice,” he wrote, is “nothing less than an attempt to celebrate the creative impulse as a means of salvation, not only for the individual but also for society.” mr. singleton directed a variety of films over the next 20 years, but none had the impact of “boyz.” they included “rosewood” (1997), a re-enactment of a mob attack against black people in florida in the early 1920s; “shaft” (2000), a remake of the hit 1971 film; “baby boy” (2001), a coming-of-age story; “2 fast 2 furious” (2003), an early entry in the “fast and the furious” franchise; and “four brothers” (2005), a crime drama. he also moved into television, directing episodes of “empire,” “the people v. o.j. simpson: american crime story” and “billions.” he is survived by his parents; his daughters justice singleton, hadar busia-singleton, cleopatra singleton, selenesol singleton and isis singleton, and his sons, maasai and seven. mr. singleton produced some of the films he directed, as well as other movies, like craig brewer’s “hustle and flow” (2005), which starred terrence howard, who earned an oscar nomination for best actor. the film won an oscar for best original song. his most recent venture was “snowfall,” a series on fx about the crack cocaine epidemic in los angeles in the 1980s. mr. singleton was one of the show’s creators and executive producers and directed three episodes. “ ‘snowfall’ manages to carve out its own distinctive visual style, leaning heavily on the contrast between the bright blue l.a. sky and the violence and crime happening beneath it,” kelly lawler of usa today wrote in a review after the series’ debut. “even in moments of harrowing violence, it’s hard to look away.” for mr. singleton, “snowfall” was a return to the turf that inspired “boyz,” with a vehicle that he likened to making a movie every week. “it’s a popular show, and i could have done it 20 years ago,” he told the hollywood reporter in 2018. “but they said, ‘who wants to see “boyz n the hood” on television every week?’ now everybody wants to see ‘boyz n the hood’ on television.”",2019-04-29,"Date: 2019-04-29

Obituary:
dr. bernard d. davis, a harvard medical school professor who attracted widespread attention in a 1976 dispute about medical schools' admission standards, died on friday at his home in belmont, mass. he was 78. the cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, elizabeth. dr. davis was the adele lehman professor of bacterial physiology at the medical school from 1968 until 1984, when he retired. he joined the faculty in 1957. in 1976, in the ""sounding board"" section of the new england journal of medicine, he asserted that academic standards in american medical schools had declined in recent years as the result of the admission of some members of minorities with substandard academic qualifications. officials at harvard termed dr. davis's action ""irresponsible."" among those who disputed his assertion was dr. john a. d. cooper, president of the association of american medical colleges, who responded that students admitted to medical schools had increasingly higher grade averages and test scores, even as more minority students were being accepted. dr. davis later explained that he was not talking about all minority students, but was ""raising questions about a small fraction."" he also apologized for his share of what he called the ""misinterpretation"" of his article by the press. he was born in franklin, mass., and graduated in 1936 from harvard college. in 1940 he graduated summa cum laude from harvard medical school. his writings included the book ""storm over biology: essays on science, sentiment, and public policy"" (prometheus, 1986). he married elizabeth menzel in 1955. in addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, jonathan, of san francisco, and franklin, of newton, mass.; a daughter, kate, of manhattan; a brother, lawrence, of boston; two sisters, dr. evelyn waitzkin and marion cahan, both of brookline, mass., and two grandchildren. editor's note: an obituary on jan. 17 reported the death on jan. 14 of dr. bernard d. davis, a harvard medical school professor who was a pioneer in bac terial genetics. the first sentence and much of the obituary were de voted to a dispute over an article dr. davis wrote in 1976 about academic standards in the admission of minor ity students to medical schools. although the controversy was re ported extensively in the times at the time, and was therefore well represented in the newspaper's clip ping file, it was not the dominant fact in dr. davis's career, as a number of scientists have explained in letters to the times. the jan. 17 obituary relied excessively on this file, in place of necessary reporting on the range of dr. davis's career. a more complete obituary ap pears today on page 28. dr. bernard d. davis (1957)",1994-01-17,"Date: 1994-01-17

dr. john d. smith a harvard medical school professor who attracted widespread attention in a 1976 dispute about medical schools' admission standards, died on friday at his home in belmont, mass. he was 78. the cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, elizabeth. dr. smith was the adele lehman professor of bacterial physiology at the medical school from 1968 until 1984, when he retired. he joined the faculty in 1957. in 1976, in the ""sounding board"" section of the new england journal of medicine, he asserted that academic standards in american medical schools had declined in recent years as the result of the admission of some members of minorities with substandard academic qualifications. officials at harvard termed dr. smith s action ""irresponsible."" among those who disputed his assertion was dr. john a. d. cooper, president of the association of american medical colleges, who responded that students admitted to medical schools had increasingly higher grade averages and test scores, even as more minority students were being accepted. dr. smith later explained that he was not talking about all minority students, but was ""raising questions about a small fraction."" he also apologized for his share of what he called the ""misinterpretation"" of his article by the press. he was born in franklin, mass., and graduated in 1936 from harvard college. in 1940 he graduated summa cum laude from harvard medical school. his writings included the book ""storm over biology: essays on science, sentiment, and public policy"" (prometheus, 1986). he married elizabeth menzel in 1955. in addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, jonathan, of san francisco, and franklin, of newton, mass.; a daughter, kate, of manhattan; a brother, lawrence, of boston; two sisters, dr. evelyn waitzkin and marion cahan, both of brookline, mass., and two grandchildren. editor's note: an obituary on jan. 17 reported the death on jan. 14 of dr. john d. smith a harvard medical school professor who was a pioneer in bac terial genetics. the first sentence and much of the obituary were de voted to a dispute over an article dr. smith wrote in 1976 about academic standards in the admission of minor ity students to medical schools. although the controversy was re ported extensively in the times at the time, and was therefore well represented in the newspaper's clip ping file, it was not the dominant fact in dr. smith s career, as a number of scientists have explained in letters to the times. the jan. 17 obituary relied excessively on this file, in place of necessary reporting on the range of dr. smith s career. a more complete obituary ap pears today on page 28. dr. john d. smith (1957)"

donald w. davis, who transformed stanley works from a tradition-bound new england tool manufacturer into an international pioneer in the do-it-yourself hardware business, died on sept. 11. he was 89. the cause was lymphoma, a form of cancer he had been successfully treated for 30 years earlier, his son donald davis iii said. mr. davis, who spent 39 years with stanley works, was already something of a company veteran, having worked there for 18 years when, at the age of 44, he became its president and chief executive in 1966. he set out to modernize and expand the company, based in new britain, conn.: adding product lines, overhauling its marketing operations, buying 25 other tool manufacturers and listing the company on the new york stock exchange. after a trip to england in the mid-1960s, where a few tool companies had begun marketing to homeowners, mr. davis began shifting stanley works’ focus from industrial supply to the nascent do-it-yourself market in the united states. “don had the vision that if stanley marketed to the professional, then the weekend guy, like you and i, would want to use the same tools,” said stewart gentsch, a former executive at the company. mr. davis, the son of an advertising professor at pennsylvania state university, even coined the company motto, “stanley helps you do things right,” which dominated its advertising for years. under mr. davis’s leadership, the company’s work force doubled, to nearly 20,000, and its revenue grew to $1.9 billion in 1989, from $230 million in 1966. but many of those jobs were in cities or foreign countries where stanley works had begun shifting much of its manufacturing to take advantage of lower labor and production costs. its operations in connecticut, where the company was founded in 1843 and had grown as part of the state’s once-thriving industrial midsection, suffered repeated job losses. mr. davis fought to keep stanley works from moving out of connecticut altogether and in 1984 presided over the opening of its new headquarters in new britain. “i think of us as an international company headquartered here,” he told the new york times in 1989, “but i hesitate to use the word ‘global’ because it gives the impression of rootlessness.” the company’s job losses in connecticut nonetheless accelerated after mr. davis retired in 1987 and moved from new britain to homes in martha’s vineyard and florida. by the late 1990s, he stopped visiting connecticut because his encounters with laid-off employees had become “much too personal,” he said in the 2006 book “the disposable american: layoffs and their consequences,” by louis uchitelle, a reporter for the times. in 2009, the company announced its purchase of another toolmaker, black and decker, and adopted the name stanley black and decker. donald walter davis was born on june 10, 1921, in springfield, mass., and earned a degree in journalism from penn state university before joining the navy during world war ii. he attended harvard business school on the g.i. bill of rights after the war and in 1948 was hired as general manager of labor relations at stanley works. mr. davis taught at the sloan school of management at the massachusetts institute of technology for 22 years. he moved to hobe sound, fla., after his retirement. in addition to his son donald, mr. davis is survived by his wife, virginia cooper davis; his sister, maralyn mazza; five other children, randall, deborah kvam, palmer, jennifer and ruthie; and 12 grandchildren.",2010-09-17,"Date: 2010-09-17

Obituary title: philip roth, american literary giant, dies at 85
Obituary:
philip roth, the prolific, protean, and often blackly comic novelist who was a pre-eminent figure in 20th-century literature, died on tuesday night at a hospital in manhattan. he was 85.the writer judith thurman, a close friend, said the cause was congestive heart failure. mr. roth had homes in manhattan and connecticut.in the course of a very long career, mr. roth took on many guises -- mainly versions of himself -- in the exploration of what it means to be an american, a jew, a writer, a man. he was a champion of eastern european novelists like ivan klima and bruno schulz, and also a passionate student of american history and the american vernacular. and more than just about any other writer of his time, he was tireless in his exploration of male sexuality.his creations include alexander portnoy, a teenager so libidinous, he has sex with both his baseball mitt and the family dinner, and david kepesh, a professor who turns into an exquisitely sensitive 155-pound female breast.mr. roth was the last of the great white males: the triumvirate of writers -- saul bellow and john updike were the others -- who towered over american letters in the second half of the 20th century. outliving both and borne aloft by an extraordinary second wind, mr. roth wrote more novels than either of them. in 2005 he became only the third living writer (after bellow and eudora welty) to have his books enshrined in the library of america.[new to philip roth? here's how to get started on reading his books.]""updike and bellow hold their flashlights out into the world, reveal the world as it is now,"" mr. roth once said. ""i dig a hole and shine my flashlight into the hole.""the nobel prize eluded mr. roth, but he won most of the other top honors: two national book awards, two national book critics circle awards, three pen/faulkner awards, a pulitzer prize and the man booker international prize.in his 60s, a time of life when many writers are winding down, he produced an exceptional sequence of historical novels -- ""american pastoral,"" ""the human stain"" and ""i married a communist"" -- products of his personal re-engagement with america and american themes.and starting with ""everyman"" in 2006, when he was 73, he kept up a relentless book-a-year pace, publishing works that while not necessarily major were nevertheless fiercely intelligent and sharply observed. their theme in one way or another was the ravages of age and mortality itself, and in publishing them he seemed to be defiantly staving off his own decline.mr. roth was often lumped together with bellow and bernard malamud as part of the ""hart, schaffner and marx of american letters,"" but he resisted the label. ""the epithet american-jewish writer has no meaning for me,"" he said. ""if i'm not an american, i'm nothing.""and yet, almost against his will sometimes, he was drawn again and again to writing about themes of jewish identity, anti-semitism and the jewish experience in america. he returned often, especially in his later work, to the weequahic neighborhood of newark, where he had grown up and which became in his writing a kind of vanished eden: a place of middle-class pride, frugality, diligence and aspiration.[click here to read about how readers reacted to philip roth's death.]it was a place where no one was unaware ""of the power to intimidate that emanated from the highest and lowest reaches of gentile america,"" he wrote, and yet where being jewish and being american were practically indistinguishable. speaking of his father in ""the facts,"" an autobiography, mr. roth said: ""his repertoire has never been large: family, family, family, newark, newark, newark, jew, jew, jew. somewhat like mine.""reality and fiction blurmr. roth's favorite vehicle for exploring this repertoire was himself, or rather one of several fictional alter egos he deployed as a go-between, negotiating the tricky boundary between autobiography and invention and deliberately blurring the boundaries between real life and fiction. nine of mr. roth's novels are narrated by nathan zuckerman, a novelist whose career closely parallels that of his creator. three more are narrated by david kepesh, a writerly academic who shares some of mr. roth's preoccupations, women especially. and sometimes mr. roth dispensed with the disguise altogether -- or seemed to.the protagonist of ""operation shylock"" is a character named philip roth, who is being impersonated by another character, who stole roth's identity. at the center of ""the plot against america,"" a book that invents an america where charles lindbergh wins the 1940 presidential election and initiates a secret pogrom against jews, is a new jersey family named roth that resembles the author's in every particular.""making fake biography, false history, concocting a half-imaginary existence out of the actual drama of my life is my life,"" mr. roth told hermione lee in a 1984 interview in the paris review. ""there has to be some pleasure in this life, and that's it.""occasionally, as in ""deception,"" a slender 1990 novel about a writer named philip who is writing about a writer having an affair with one of his made-up characters, this sleight of hand feels stuntlike and a little dizzying. more often, and especially in ""the counterlife"" (1986), mr. roth's masterpiece in this vein, what results is a profound investigation into the competing and overlapping claims of fiction and reality, in which each aspires to the condition of the other and the very idea of a self becomes a fabrication at once heroic and treacherous.mr. roth's other great theme was sex, or male lust, which in his books is both a life force and a principle of rage and disorder. it is sex, the uncontrollable need to have it, that torments poor, guilt-ridden portnoy, almost certainly mr. roth's most famous character, who desperately wants to ""be bad -- and to enjoy it."" and mickey sabbath, the protagonist of ""sabbath's theater,"" one of mr. roth's major late-career novels, is in many ways portnoy grown old but still in the grip of lust and longing, raging against the indignity of old age and yet saved from suicidal impulses by the realization that there are too many people he loves to hate.in public mr. roth, tall and good-looking, was gracious and charming but with little use for small talk. in private he was a gifted mimic and comedian. friends used to say that if his writing career had ever fizzled he could have made a nice living doing stand-up. but there was about his person, as about his writing, a kind of simmering intensity, an impatience with art that didn't take itself seriously.some writers ""pretend to be more lovable than they are and some pretend to be less,"" he told ms. lee. ""beside the point. literature isn't a moral beauty contest. its power arises from the authority and audacity with which the impersonation is pulled off; the belief it inspires is what counts.""philip milton roth was born in newark on march 19, 1933, the younger of two sons. (his brother, sanford, a commercial artist known as sandy, died in 2009.) his father, herman, was an insurance manager for metropolitan life who felt that his career had been thwarted by the gentile executives who ran the company. mr. roth once described him as a cross between captain ahab and willy loman. his mother, the former bess finkel, was a secretary before she married and then became a housekeeper of the heroic old school -- the kind, he once suggested, who raised cleaning to an art form.the family lived in a five-room apartment on summit avenue within which were only three books when he was growing up -- given as presents when someone was ill, mr. roth said. he went to weequahic high, where he was a good student but not good enough to win a scholarship to rutgers, as he had hoped. in 1951 he enrolled as a pre-law student at the newark branch of rutgers, with vague notions of becoming ""a lawyer for the underdog.""but he yearned to live away from home, and the following year he transferred to bucknell university in lewisburg, pa., a place about which he knew almost nothing except that a newark neighbor seemed to have thrived there. inspired by one of his professors, mildred martin, with whom he remained a lasting friend, mr. roth switched his interests from law to literature. he helped found a campus literary magazine, where in an early burst of his satirical power he published a parody of the college newspaper so devastating that it earned him an admonition from the dean.mr. roth graduated from bucknell, magna cum laude, in 1954 and won a scholarship to the university of chicago, where he was awarded an m.a. in 1955. that same year, rather than wait for the draft, he enlisted in the army but suffered a back injury during basic training and received a medical discharge. he returned to chicago in 1956 to study for a ph.d. in english but dropped out after one term.irritating the rabbismr. roth had begun to write and publish short stories by then, and in 1959 he won a houghton mifflin fellowship to publish what became his first collection, ""goodbye, columbus."" it won the national book award in 1960 but was denounced -- in an inkling of trouble to come -- by some influential rabbis, who objected to the portrayal of the worldly, assimilated patimkin family in the title novella, and even more to the story ""defender of the faith,"" about a jewish army sergeant plagued by goldbricking draftees of his own faith.in 1962, while appearing on a panel at yeshiva university, mr. roth was so denounced, for that story especially, that he resolved never to write about jews again. he quickly changed his mind.""my humiliation before the yeshiva belligerents -- indeed, the angry jewish resistance that i aroused virtually from the start -- was the luckiest break i could have had,"" he wrote. ""i was branded.""mr. roth later called his first two novels ""apprentice work."" ""letting go,"" published in 1962, was derived in about equal parts from bellow and henry james. ""when she was good,"" which came out in 1967, is the most un-rothian of his books, a theodore dreiser- or sherwood anderson-like story set in the wasp midwest in the 1940s.""when she was good"" was based in part on the life and family of margaret martinson williams, with whom mr. roth had entered a calamitous relationship in 1959. ms. williams, who was divorced and had a son and a daughter, met mr. roth while she was waiting tables in chicago, and she tricked him into marriage by pretending to be pregnant. he was ""enslaved"" to her own sense of victimization, he wrote. they separated in 1963, but ms. williams refused to divorce, and she remained a vexatious presence in his life until she died in a car crash in 1968. (she appears as josie jensen in ""the facts"" and, more or less undisguised, as the exasperating maureen tarnopol in mr. roth's novel ""my life as a man."")after the separation, mr. roth moved back east and began work on ""portnoy's complaint,"" which surely set a record for most masturbation scenes per page. it was a breakthrough not just for mr. roth but for american letters, which had never known anything like it: an extended, unhinged monologue, at once filthy and hilarious, by a neurotic young jewish man trying to break free of his suffocating parents and tormented by a longing to have sex with gentile women, shiksas.the book was ""an experiment in verbal exuberance,"" mr. roth said, and it deliberately broke all the rules.the novel, published in 1969, became a best seller but received mixed reviews. josh greenfeld, writing in the new york times book review, called it ""the very novel that every american-jewish writer has been trying to write in one guise or another since the end of world war ii.""on the other hand, irving howe (on whom mr. roth later modeled the pompous, stuffy critic milton appel in ""the anatomy lesson"") wrote in a lengthy takedown in 1972, ""the cruelest thing anyone can do with 'portnoy's complaint' is read it twice.""and once again the rabbis complained. gershom scholem, the great kabbalah scholar, declared that the book was more harmful to jews than ""the protocols of the elders of zion.""mr. roth's autobiographical phase began in 1974 with ""my life as a man,"" which he said was probably the least factually altered of his books, and continued with the zuckerman trilogy -- ""the ghost writer"" (1979), ""zuckerman unbound"" (1981) and ""the anatomy lesson"" (1983) -- which examined the authorial vocation and even the nature of writing itself.zuckerman reappeared in ""the counterlife"" (1986), where he seems to die of a heart attack and is then resurrected. ""operation shylock"" (1993), which mr. roth pretended was a ""confession,"" not a novel (though in the very last sentence he says, ""this confession is false""), involved two roths, one real and one phony, and the real one claims to have been a spy for the mossad. the book, with its sense of shifting reality and unstable identity, partly stemmed from a near-breakdown mr. roth experienced when he became addicted to the sleeping pill halcion after knee surgery in 1987 and from severe depression he suffered after emergency bypass surgery in 1989.for much of this time mr. roth had been spending half the year in london with the actress claire bloom, with whom he began living in 1976. they married in 1990 but divorced four years later. in 1996, ms. bloom published a memoir, ""leaving the doll's house,"" in which she depicted him as a misogynist and control freak, so self-involved that he refused to let her daughter, from her marriage to the actor rod steiger, live with them because she bored him.never fond of attention, mr. roth became even more reclusive after this accusation and never publicly replied to it, though he privately denied it. some critics found unflattering parallels to ms. bloom and her daughter in the characters eve frame and her daughter, sylphid, in ""i married a communist.""an american trilogythe marriage over, mr. roth moved permanently back to the united states and began what proved to be the third major phase of his career. he returned, he said, because he felt out of touch: ""it was really my rediscovering america as a writer.""""sabbath's theater,"" which came out in 1995 and won the national book award, is about neither roth nor zuckerman but rather morris sabbath, known as mickey, an ex-puppeteer in his 60s. his voice is nothing if not american: an angry, comic, lustful harangue.""in this new book life is represented as anarchic horniness on the rampage against death and its harbingers, old age and impotence,"" frank kermode wrote in the new york review of books, adding, ""there is really only one way for him to tell the story -- defiantly with outraged phallic energy.""like ""portnoy's complaint,"" ""sabbath's theater"" seemed to liberate its author, and yet the work that followed -- what mr. roth called his american trilogy: ""american pastoral,"" ""i married a communist"" and ""the human stain"" -- is less about sex than about history or traumatic moments in american culture. zuckerman returns as the narrator of all three novels, but he is in his 60s now, impotent and suffering from prostate cancer. his prose is plainer, crisper, less show-offy, and he is less an actor than an observer and interpreter.the books are full of dense reportorial detail -- about such seemingly un-rothian subjects as glove making and ice fishing -- as they tell job-like stories. there is swede levov (""american pastoral""), a seemingly gilded newark businessman, a gifted athlete married to miss new jersey of 1949, whose life is destroyed in the 1960s when his teenage daughter becomes an antiwar terrorist and plants a bomb that kills an innocent bystander. ira ringold (""i married a communist"") is a star of a radio serial during the mccarthy era who is blacklisted and becomes the subject of an exposé published by his own wife. and coleman silk (""the human stain), a black classics professor passing as white, commits an innocent classroom gaffe while the clinton impeachment is taking place and finds himself mercilessly hounded by the politically correct.these books are not without their comic moments, but history here is no joke; it is more nearly a tragedy. in 2007, mr. roth killed zuckerman off in the sad and affecting ""exit ghost,"" a novel that cleverly echoes and inverts the themes of ""the ghost writer,"" the first of the zuckerman novels. meanwhile he had begun writing a series of shorter novels that, after the publication of ""nemesis"" in 2010, he began calling ""nemeses."" the sequence began with ""everyman,"" which starts in a graveyard and ends on an operating table.that work set the tone for the rest: ""indignation"" (2008), a ghost story of sorts about a young student unfairly expelled from college and sent off to fight in the korean war; ""the humbling"" (2009), about an actor who has lost his powers; and ""nemesis,"" about the polio epidemic of the 1950s. the prose became even sparer and, in the case of ""nemesis,"" deliberately matter-of-fact and unliterary, and though the books have plenty of sexual moments, they are haunted by something darker and bleaker.yet the very existence of these books, coming reliably almost one every year, seemed to belie their message. ""time doesn't prey on my mind. it should, but it doesn't,"" mr. roth told david remnick in the new yorker in 2000. he added: ""i don't know yet what this will all add up to, and it no longer matters, because there's no stopping. all you want to do is the obvious. just get it right.""some of his novels were adapted for the movies: ""goodbye, columbus"" in 1969, ""the human stain"" in 2003 and ""american pastoral"" and ""indignation"" in 2016.increasingly in his later years, mr. roth spent most of his time alone in his 18th-century farmhouse in northwest connecticut, returning to new york mostly in the winter, when he grew so stir-crazy, he found himself talking to woodchucks. he worked, read in the evenings and occasionally listened to a ballgame. in some ways he came to resemble his own creation, nathan zuckerman, who asks at the end of a chapter in ""exit ghost,"" ""isn't one's pain quotient shocking enough without fictional amplification, without giving things an intensity that is ephemeral in life and sometimes even unseen?""""not for some,"" he goes on. ""for some very, very few that amplification, evolving uncertainly out of nothing, constitutes their only assurance, and the unlived, the surmise, fully drawn in print on paper, is the life whose meaning comes to matter most.""in 2010, right after ""nemesis,"" mr. roth decided to quit writing. he didn't tell anyone at first, because, as he said, he didn't want to be like frank sinatra, announcing his retirement one minute and making a comeback the next. but he stuck with his plan, and, in 2012, he officially announced that he was done. a post-it note on his computer said, ""the struggle with writing is done.""he had been famous for putting in endless days at his stand-up desk, throwing out more pages than he kept, and in a 2018 interview he said he was worn out. ""i was by this time no longer in possession of the mental vitality or the physical fitness needed to mount and sustain a large creative attack of any duration,"" he said.he settled into the contented life of an upper west side retiree, seeing friends, going to concerts. he was in frequent communication with his appointed biographer, blake bailey, whom he sometimes flooded with notes, and he was also at pains to straighten out an erroneous wikipedia account of his life. mostly, he read -- nonfiction by preference, but he made exception for the occasional novel. one of the last he read was ""asymmetry,"" by lisa halliday, a book about a young woman who has a romance with an aging novelist who bears an unmistakable resemblance to mr. roth -- funny, kind, acerbic, passionate, immensely well-read, a devotee of zabar's and old movies.in an interview, mr. roth acknowledged that he and ms. halliday had been friends, and added: ""she got me.""credit: charles mcgrath; matt stevens contributed reporting.the roth family, with philip in front. he grew up in weequahic, a newark neighborhood. in his writing it was a kind of vanished eden.

Obituary title: john smith american literary giant, dies at 85
Obituary: john smith the prolific, protean, and often blackly comic novelist who was a pre-eminent figure in 20th-century literature, died on tuesday night at a hospital in manhattan. he was 85.the writer judith thurman, a close friend, said the cause was congestive heart failure. mr. smith had homes in manhattan and connecticut.in the course of a very long career, mr. smith took on many guises -- mainly versions of himself -- in the exploration of what it means to be an american, a jew, a writer, a man. he was a champion of eastern european novelists like ivan klima and bruno schulz, and also a passionate student of american history and the american vernacular. and more than just about any other writer of his time, he was tireless in his exploration of male sexuality.his creations include alexander portnoy, a teenager so libidinous, he has sex with both his baseball mitt and the family dinner, and david kepesh, a professor who turns into an exquisitely sensitive 155-pound female breast.mr. smith was the last of the great white males: the triumvirate of writers -- saul bellow and john updike were the others -- who towered over american letters in the second half of the 20th century. outliving both and borne aloft by an extraordinary second wind, mr. smith wrote more novels than either of them. in 2005 he became only the third living writer (after bellow and eudora welty) to have his books enshrined in the library of america.[new to john smith here's how to get started on reading his books.]""updike and bellow hold their flashlights out into the world, reveal the world as it is now,"" mr. smith once said. ""i dig a hole and shine my flashlight into the hole.""the nobel prize eluded mr. smith but he won most of the other top honors: two national book awards, two national book critics circle awards, three pen/faulkner awards, a pulitzer prize and the man booker international prize.in his 60s, a time of life when many writers are winding down, he produced an exceptional sequence of historical novels -- ""american pastoral,"" ""the human stain"" and ""i married a communist"" -- products of his personal re-engagement with america and american themes.and starting with ""everyman"" in 2006, when he was 73, he kept up a relentless book-a-year pace, publishing works that while not necessarily major were nevertheless fiercely intelligent and sharply observed. their theme in one way or another was the ravages of age and mortality itself, and in publishing them he seemed to be defiantly staving off his own decline.mr. smith was often lumped together with bellow and bernard malamud as part of the ""hart, schaffner and marx of american letters,"" but he resisted the label. ""the epithet american-jewish writer has no meaning for me,"" he said. ""if i'm not an american, i'm nothing.""and yet, almost against his will sometimes, he was drawn again and again to writing about themes of jewish identity, anti-semitism and the jewish experience in america. he returned often, especially in his later work, to the weequahic neighborhood of newark, where he had grown up and which became in his writing a kind of vanished eden: a place of middle-class pride, frugality, diligence and aspiration.[click here to read about how readers reacted to john smith s death.]it was a place where no one was unaware ""of the power to intimidate that emanated from the highest and lowest reaches of gentile america,"" he wrote, and yet where being jewish and being american were practically indistinguishable. speaking of his father in ""the facts,"" an autobiography, mr. smith said: ""his repertoire has never been large: family, family, family, newark, newark, newark, jew, jew, jew. somewhat like mine.""reality and fiction blurmr. smith s favorite vehicle for exploring this repertoire was himself, or rather one of several fictional alter egos he deployed as a go-between, negotiating the tricky boundary between autobiography and invention and deliberately blurring the boundaries between real life and fiction. nine of mr. smith s novels are narrated by nathan zuckerman, a novelist whose career closely parallels that of his creator. three more are narrated by david kepesh, a writerly academic who shares some of mr. smith s preoccupations, women especially. and sometimes mr. smith dispensed with the disguise altogether -- or seemed to.the protagonist of ""operation shylock"" is a character named john smith who is being impersonated by another character, who stole smith s identity. at the center of ""the plot against america,"" a book that invents an america where charles lindbergh wins the 1940 presidential election and initiates a secret pogrom against jews, is a new jersey family named smith that resembles the author's in every particular.""making fake biography, false history, concocting a half-imaginary existence out of the actual drama of my life is my life,"" mr. smith told hermione lee in a 1984 interview in the paris review.

""operation shylock"" (1993), which mr. smith pretended was a ""confession,"" not a novel (though in the very last sentence he says, ""this confession is false""), involved two roths, one real and one phony, and the real one claims to have been a spy for the mossad. the book, with its sense of shifting reality and unstable identity, partly stemmed from a near-breakdown mr. smith experienced when he became addicted to the sleeping pill halcion after knee surgery in 1987 and from severe depression he suffered after emergency bypass surgery in 1989.for much of this time mr. smith had been spending half the year in london with the actress claire bloom, with whom he began living in 1976. they married in 1990 but divorced four years later. in 1996, ms. bloom published a memoir, ""leaving the doll's house,"" in which she depicted him as a misogynist and control freak, so self-involved that he refused to let her daughter, from her marriage to the actor rod steiger, live with them because she bored him.never fond of attention, mr. smith became even more reclusive after this accusation and never publicly replied to it, though he privately denied it. some critics found unflattering parallels to ms. bloom and her daughter in the characters eve frame and her daughter, sylphid, in ""i married a communist.""an american trilogythe marriage over, mr. smith moved permanently back to the united states and began what proved to be the third major phase of his career. he returned, he said, because he felt out of touch: ""it was really my rediscovering america as a writer.""""sabbath's theater,"" which came out in 1995 and won the national book award, is about neither smith nor zuckerman but rather morris sabbath, known as mickey, an ex-puppeteer in his 60s. his voice is nothing if not american: an angry, comic, lustful harangue.""in this new book life is represented as anarchic horniness on the rampage against death and its harbingers, old age and impotence,"" frank kermode wrote in the new york review of books, adding, ""there is really only one way for him to tell the story -- defiantly with outraged phallic energy.""like ""portnoy's complaint,"" ""sabbath's theater"" seemed to liberate its author, and yet the work that followed -- what mr. smith called his american trilogy: ""american pastoral,"" ""i married a communist"" and ""the human stain"" -- is less about sex than about history or traumatic moments in american culture. zuckerman returns as the narrator of all three novels, but he is in his 60s now, impotent and suffering from prostate cancer. his prose is plainer, crisper, less show-offy, and he is less an actor than an observer and interpreter.the books are full of dense reportorial detail -- about such seemingly un-rothian subjects as glove making and ice fishing -- as they tell job-like stories. there is swede levov (""american pastoral""), a seemingly gilded newark businessman, a gifted athlete married to miss new jersey of 1949, whose life is destroyed in the 1960s when his teenage daughter becomes an antiwar terrorist and plants a bomb that kills an innocent bystander. ira ringold (""i married a communist"") is a star of a radio serial during the mccarthy era who is blacklisted and becomes the subject of an exposé published by his own wife. and coleman silk (""the human stain), a black classics professor passing as white, commits an innocent classroom gaffe while the clinton impeachment is taking place and finds himself mercilessly hounded by the politically correct.these books are not without their comic moments, but history here is no joke; it is more nearly a tragedy. in 2007, mr. smith killed zuckerman off in the sad and affecting ""exit ghost,"" a novel that cleverly echoes and inverts the themes of ""the ghost writer,"" the first of the zuckerman novels. meanwhile he had begun writing a series of shorter novels that, after the publication of ""nemesis"" in 2010, he began calling ""nemeses."" the sequence began with ""everyman,"" which starts in a graveyard and ends on an operating table.that work set the tone for the rest: ""indignation"" (2008), a ghost story of sorts about a young student unfairly expelled from college and sent off to fight in the korean war; ""the humbling"" (2009), about an actor who has lost his powers; and ""nemesis,"" about the polio epidemic of the 1950s. the prose became even sparer and, in the case of ""nemesis,"" deliberately matter-of-fact and unliterary, and though the books have plenty of sexual moments, they are haunted by something darker and bleaker.yet the very existence of these books, coming reliably almost one every year, seemed to belie their message. ""time doesn't prey on my mind. it should, but it doesn't,"" mr. smith told david remnick in the new yorker in 2000. he added: ""i don't know yet what this will all add up to, and it no longer matters, because there's no stopping. all you want to do is the obvious. just get it right.""some of his novels were adapted for the movies: ""goodbye, columbus"" in 1969, ""the human stain"" in 2003 and ""american pastoral"" and ""indignation"" in 2016.increasingly in his later years, mr. smith spent most of his time alone in his 18th-century farmhouse in northwest connecticut, returning to new york mostly in the winter, when he grew so stir-crazy, he found himself talking to woodchucks. he worked, read in the evenings and occasionally listened to a ballgame. in some ways he came to resemble his own creation, nathan zuckerman, who asks at the end of a chapter in ""exit ghost,"" ""isn't one's pain quotient shocking enough without fictional amplification, without giving things an intensity that is ephemeral in life and sometimes even unseen?""""not for some,"" he goes on. ""for some very, very few that amplification, evolving uncertainly out of nothing, constitutes their only assurance, and the unlived, the surmise, fully drawn in print on paper, is the life whose meaning comes to matter most.""in 2010, right after ""nemesis,"" mr. smith decided to quit writing. he didn't tell anyone at first, because, as he said, he didn't want to be like frank sinatra, announcing his retirement one minute and making a comeback the next. but he stuck with his plan, and, in 2012, he officially announced that he was done. a post-it note on his computer said, ""the struggle with writing is done.""he had been famous for putting in endless days at his stand-up desk, throwing out more pages than he kept, and in a 2018 interview he said he was worn out. ""i was by this time no longer in possession of the mental vitality or the physical fitness needed to mount and sustain a large creative attack of any duration,"" he said.he settled into the contented life of an upper west side retiree, seeing friends, going to concerts. he was in frequent communication with his appointed biographer, blake bailey, whom he sometimes flooded with notes, and he was also at pains to straighten out an erroneous wikipedia account of his life. mostly, he read -- nonfiction by preference, but he made exception for the occasional novel. one of the last he read was ""asymmetry,"" by lisa halliday, a book about a young woman who has a romance with an aging novelist who bears an unmistakable resemblance to mr. smith -- funny, kind, acerbic, passionate, immensely well-read, a devotee of zabar's and old movies.in an interview, mr. smith acknowledged that he and ms. halliday had been friends, and added: ""she got me.""credit: charles mcgrath; matt stevens contributed reporting.the smith family, with john in front. he grew up in weequahic, a newark neighborhood. in his writing it was a kind of vanished eden.

Obituary title: john mcmeel, a newspaper syndicator with a difference, dies at 85
Obituary:
in an undated image provided via andrews mcmeel publishing, john mcmeel and james andrews shortly after they started universal press syndicate in a basement in kansas. mcmeel, a founder of what began as a basement operation in a rented ranch house in kansas — with a mail drop on fifth avenue — and grew into the largest newspaper syndication company in the world, died on july 7, 2021, at his home in kansas city, mo. he was 85. (via andrews mcmeel publishing via the new york times) john mcmeel, co-founder of what began as a basement operation in a rented ranch house in kansas, with a mail drop on fifth avenue in new york city, and grew into the largest newspaper syndication company in the world, died july 7 at his home in kansas city, missouri. he was 85. his death was announced by his company, andrews mcmeel universal, which did not specify the cause. mcmeel and jim andrews were holding day jobs in the late 1960s — mcmeel as a salesperson for hall, a newspaper syndication company in new york city, and andrews as managing editor of the national catholic reporter in kansas city — but they were already moonlighting as the syndication moguls they would one day become. before their company had any clients, it had a name, universal press syndicate, which they chose because it sounded grown-up and corporate and as if it had been around forever. andrews gave himself a pseudonym, john kennedy, for the president he had idolized. andrews, a cerebral former roman catholic seminarian living in leawood, kansas, trawled for content creators such as garry trudeau, whom he found in the pages of the yale daily news. (trudeau was a yale junior writing a strip called “bull tales” about a college quarterback named b.d. — the character who became the world-weary warrior in trudeau’s “doonesbury” — and the partners had to wait for him to graduate, and for the threat of the military draft to pass, before signing him up.) mcmeel, a waggish and charming law school dropout, was the salesperson. it was mcmeel’s job to explain to staid newspaper editors raised on “beetle bailey” why they needed to freshen up their pages with contemporary voices such as trudeau’s. when “bull tales” morphed into “doonesbury” and first appeared in newspapers in 1970, it made universal press syndicate a bona fide company. the partners soon quit their day jobs. the two “were a breath of fresh air in the syndicate business,” jim squires, a former editor of the chicago tribune and the orlando sentinel, said in an unpublished oral history of universal. “newspapers were still trying to live in the 18th century. we still had ‘hot type.’ our idea of comic strips was ‘little orphan annie’ and ‘dick tracy.’” around the time they were wooing trudeau, the partners had also been courting garry wills, author and journalist (and, like andrews, a former catholic seminarian), who had been writing for esquire. mcmeel did the courting, although wills was initially reluctant: his former boss at national review, william f. buckley jr., had counseled him against writing a column for syndication. but then, in may 1970, 13 students at kent state university in ohio were shot by national guard troops while protesting the war in vietnam. four died. “esquire had a two-month lead time” before an article could be published, wills said in a phone interview. “i felt so left behind by the pace of the horrible things that were happening, i would have accepted any terms to get into a paper the next day. i called jim and left a message. i flew to kent state and i filed that day.” wills’ column for universal would run in hundreds of newspapers for the next three decades. andrews and mcmeel went on to gather a stable of commentators who were chronicling those roiling times. “they thought it was their job to make writers and cartoonists happy and rich and put them in as many papers as possible,” political columnist mary mcgrory wrote when the company turned 25. she was one of the many banner names at the washington star — james kilpatrick and buckley were others — whom andrews and mcmeel picked up in 1979 in an arrangement under which time inc., which owned the star, invested in universal and gave it the rights to syndicate the newspaper’s columnists. the linchpin of the deal was that “doonesbury,” a pulitzer prize winner that had been running in the washington post, would move to the star. and mcmeel was going to have to tell ben bradlee, the post’s volatile editor. it did not go well, and bradlee told mcmeel that one day he’d crawl back to the post on his hands and knees — which he did, two years later, when the star closed. mcmeel blamed his partner. the two had had an agreement that if anything ever went wrong, each man would say it was the other’s fault. but mcmeel’s finger-pointing came as a bit of mordant humor: andrews had died a year earlier. not only was universal putting fresh voices such as trudeau and wills into newspapers, the company was also doing all sorts of unheard-of things, such as granting trudeau the rights to his work, forgoing the immense profits that would have come from licensing deals. universal did the same for bill watterson, the graphic designer who created “calvin and hobbes,” the wildly popular strip featuring the rebellions of a 6-year-old boy (named for a 16th-century theologian) and his sidekick, a stuffed tiger (named for a 17th-century philosopher). the company also gave its stars time off: trudeau, watterson and gary larson, creator of “the far side,” all took extended leaves. cathy guisewite, whose appealing and often befuddled cartoon avatar, cathy, spoke to young women caught between the heady promises of second-wave feminism and the grind of everyday life, said andrews had been the heart and soul of the company and mcmeel the fireworks. “cartoonists and their syndicates are typically at odds with each other,” guisewite said. “but john created the opposite feeling for us. john opened up a new universe for different kinds of voices on the page. his insistence that there was room for our voices made room for others, too.” john paul mcmeel was born jan. 26, 1936, in south bend, indiana. his father, james, was the doctor for the university of notre dame’s football team; his mother, naomi (reilly) mcmeel, was a homemaker. he earned a degree in business from notre dame in 1957. mcmeel spent a year in law school at indiana university before dropping out to take a sales job at the hall syndicate. he had just started working there when he met susan sykes on a blind date. they married in 1966. he met andrews on a return visit home to south bend; still a student at notre dame, andrews was renting a room from mcmeel’s mother. in the early days of universal, andrews’ wife, kathleen, kept the books, and susan mcmeel, back in new york, read submissions. when jim andrews died suddenly in 1980 at 44, kathleen andrews returned to the company as ceo of its publishing business. she later became vice chairman of the company. she died in april at 84. universal rebranded itself as andrews mcmeel universal in the late 1980s. by then, mcmeel had signed up dear abby, erma bombeck, larson, roger ebert and pat oliphant, the arch australian-born political cartoonist. mcmeel never really retired, his wife said. at his death, he was the company’s chairman emeritus. in addition to his wife, mcmeel is survived by three daughters, maureen mcmeel carroll, suzanne mcmeel glynn and bridget mcmeel rohmer; and nine grandchildren. indefatigably sunny, mcmeel had the optimism — and the stamina — of a true salesperson. jim davis, creator of the misanthropic cat garfield, first met mcmeel at an american booksellers association convention in 1981. mcmeel approached him for an autograph, brandishing a garfield book with a contract tucked inside. but davis had a long-term contract with united media, which had been syndicating his strip. “it became a running gag,” davis said. “every time we met, he’d hand me a newspaper or something with a contract inside.” after 15 years, davis was finally free to sign with universal. “the thing with john,” davis said, “is it didn’t feel like business. i once did an interview and the reporter asked me why gary larson had retired and i was still going. i said: ‘well, gary works so hard and he puts so much pressure on himself. me, if i feel that kind of pressure, i lower my standards.’ it was that kind of air that john encouraged.” this article originally appeared in the new york times. in an undated image provided via andrews mcmeel publishing, john mcmeel. mcmeel, a founder of what began as a basement operation in a rented ranch house in kansas — with a mail drop on fifth avenue — and grew into the largest newspaper syndication company in the world, died on july 7, 2021, at his home in kansas city, mo. he was 85.

Obituary title: joaquin balaguer, 95, dies; dominated dominican life
Obituary:
joaquin balaguer, a former president of the dominican republic who was among the last of the classic latin american strongmen and one of the longest-lasting political figures of the 20th century, died yesterday at a hospital in santo domingo. he was 95. short, shrewd and indomitable, mr. balaguer ruled the caribbean nation of eight million people with a sometimes ruthless manner for 22 years and six presidential terms. his years in power spanned the country's long path from dictatorship to democracy, and he adapted to the changing climate. critics often called him the ''caudillo,'' or strongman, who would never disappear, who kept re-emerging as president no matter how many enemies he gathered along the way. he governed into his late 80's, when he was blind, practically deaf and stooped, but even then he managed to keep a tight rein on the government. in his signature dark suit and fedora, he traveled the country in a specially made car known as the balaguermobile. joining the dominican government when herbert hoover was president of the united states and retaining a powerful role in public life and politics up until the hours before his death, mr. balaguer outlasted all of his latin contemporaries except fidel castro. a lifelong bachelor who was close to his six sisters, and lived in the servants' quarters of his family mansion, mr. balaguer was hated for governing his nation with an iron fist, particularly during his first 12 years in office. he was heavily criticized then for using repressive and even brutal tactics reminiscent of his predecessor and patron, rafael trujillo. but he was also beloved for his beguiling, parental embrace of the country's most destitute people, thousands of whom made their way yesterday to the capital, santo domingo, to mourn outside his home on main street, where his body is to lie in state for three days. a lawyer, poet, university law professor, diplomat, mr. balaguer was also the author of numerous books, including one he wrote at the age of 14 and another in which he argued against interracial marriage and established him as a racist. he entered politics in 1932, ultimately becoming a key government official and protege of general trujillo, who effectively governed the country for 30 years as one of latin america's most powerful dictators. when general trujillo's brother, hector, resigned as president in 1960, mr. balaguer, who was serving as vice president, succeeded him as the nominal chief of state, in a country that shares the island of hispaniola with haiti. mr. balaguer distanced himself from general trujillo and initially carved out a more moderate political stance. after general trujillo was assassinated in 1961, he celebrated the end of the dictatorship by changing the name of the capital from ciudad trujillo back to santo domingo, the city's original name. but rioting and political turmoil erupted in 1962, and mr. balaguer was forced out of office and into exile, living briefly in new york city, where he formed his lasting right-wing political party. as the dominican republic was in the throes of civil war, he returned to the country in 1965, after president lyndon b. johnson sent in the marines and supported mr. balaguer as the leader who could stave off the threat of communism and protect the country from becoming what johnson called a ''second cuba.'' mr. balaguer was a longtime ally of the united states. in 1966, he was elected in one of the dominican republic's first freely contested elections. blending a mixture of relative economic prosperity that gave rise to the country's first solid middle class and was fueled by a seemingly endless stream of public works projects, mr. balaguer was re-elected to two more four-year terms. however, the opposition political party boycotted both elections, accusing the balaguer government of fraudulent practices, charges that would re-emerge when he was elected again. his first term, his critics said, was marked by repression and severe punishment of his enemies, including journalists and political opponents on the left. he had a firm grip on the judicial system and used to the country's military to rule the country. ''he prolonged dictatorship unnecessarily,'' bernardo vega, a former dominican ambassador to the united states who is now the editor of el caribe, a major dominican daily newspaper, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''he's part of the tradition here, the concept that dominicans need strong government.'' after three terms, mr. balaguer was defeated in presidential elections 1978 by the party in power today, the dominican revolutionary party, but he was far from politically washed up. he remained the leader of the political party he had founded in the 1960's, now called the social christian reform party, and won another bid for power in 1986, ultimately serving for another 10 years. his second period in power, experts said, was much less harsh and was more democratic than his first. still, he was considered a classic strongman, whose style was a combination of paternalism and authoritarianism. in 1990, mr. balaguer was narrowly re-elected again, and then backed down from a promise to serve only two years. in 1992, he built what became his most visible legacy, a widely criticized multimillion-dollar lighthouse that casts beams of light in the shape of a cross into the sky and was erected at a time when the country was facing 25 percent unemployment and severe electricity shortages. also during the 1990's, he clashed bitterly with haiti, as it was gripped by political turmoil. in 1994, he won again, in elections that were perceived as rigged, and under american and international pressure agreed to serve only two of the four years and end his official leadership of the country. in 2000, at 92, mr. balaguer ran for president again, but came in third. eight hours before mr. balaguer died, the country's congress amended the constitution to remove term limits that had been imposed after mr. balaguer's rule and barred the re-election of presidents. even on his death bed, mr. balaguer, who still headed the party that was supporting the amendment, was a major political player, with officials rushing to his bedside to garner his backing or ask him how to proceed, mr. vega said. mr. balaguer lived an austere life, shunning the largesse of general trujillo and other dictators. in the later years of his life, after five sisters had died, he relied on his last sibling as a top aide who would do everything from reading him the morning newspapers to helping him run the government. to his death, he remained an enigma as a politician and a person. his life and personality inspired a 1995 novel, ''they forged the signature of god,'' by viriato sencion, which drew on inside information and offended mr. balaguer. in a 1996 interview with the new york times, mr. sencion described his visits to mr. balaguer's home, to see one of his sisters. ''it was a most strange and curious household,'' he said. ''there were two female dwarfs, kept as mascots but who to this day are part of his retinue, and a pair of aggressive collies that, when they bit you, you had no choice but to sit there and smile.'' joaquin balaguer greeting voters in santo domingo on june 1, 1966.; joaquin balaguer (photographs by associated press)",2002-07-15,"Date: 2002-07-15

Obituary title: jeremy gold, 75, actuary, is dead; foresaw crisis in public pensions
Obituary:
jeremy gold, an actuary who more than 25 years ago warned of the financial debacles now slowly playing out among the cities and states that sponsor pension plans for their teachers, police officers, bus drivers and other workers, died on july 6 in manhattan. he was 75.the cause was myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia, his son, jonathan, said.in 1985, mr. gold became one of the first american actuaries to work on wall street, straying from the profession's typical career track in insurance and consulting.it was the heyday of the corporate raid, when high rollers like carl icahn and t. boone pickens were buying up companies, firing the managers, turning everything upside down and reveling in the shareholder value they claimed to have created.often, the raiders went after companies with pension funds, which happened to be mr. gold's métier. they said the funds held far more money than they needed, grabbed what they said was the surplus and used it to finance their takeovers. when the dust settled, the money was gone, and workers' hopes for a decent retirement were dashed.the raids inspired books, movies, broadway productions like ayad akhtar's ""junk"" and, eventually, a federal law slapping a punitive tax on any raider who looted a pension fund again.but for mr. gold, they raised big questions about the advice actuaries gave employers on how to run their pension plans.why did the raiders keep finding overstuffed pensions to exploit? could actuarial practices be making employers vulnerable? what if it was not just a few wrong numbers here and there, but a bedrock flaw in the actuarial standards that could lead to a systemic disaster?mr. gold eventually concluded that the standards were indeed dangerously flawed, and embarked on a 30-year mission, as he put it, ""to save my profession.""pension mishaps, he knew, would be devastating as baby boomers aged and retired, because the amounts of money involved would be vast. much like lawyers and accountants, actuaries have a professional duty to protect the public and to serve the greater good. if instead they were putting their clients in harm's way, even unintentionally, he thought, the public would eventually catch on, actuaries would be blamed, and the whole profession could go down in a cascade of ignominy and lawsuits.if the problem lay in weak actuarial standards, he concluded, the solution would be tighter standards.more than 30 years later, the tightened standards are still mostly on the drawing board, and change has come too slowly to avoid painful reckonings in places like detroit, puerto rico, stockton, calif., and perhaps, soon, chicago -- or to prevent the looming collapse of big pension plans for retired teamsters and coal miners.but the fact that stricter standards are being considered at all is testament to mr. gold's conviction that actuarial science was broken, and his refusal to stop saying so.""within the actuarial profession, jeremy has done more than anyone to move this forward,"" said ed bartholomew, a former chief financial officer of the inter-american development bank, who led a reform of the bank's pension management following the recent financial crisis.mr. bartholomew, now an independent consultant, said he thought work on new actuarial standards was ""going in the right direction.""""for that,"" he said, ""i give credit to jeremy, who has been pushing these ideas for 20 years.""but even as mr. gold won converts, he antagonized many colleagues, who believed the traditional actuarial methods were sound and thought he was harming the profession's credibility.he also earned the enmity of union officials, who thought his campaign threatened their members' benefits. in fact, mr. gold was a lifelong liberal democrat, the son of high school english teachers who knew firsthand the value of traditional pensions.he came to his understanding of the pitfalls in actuarial science during his work on wall street in the 1980s. it wasn't just the corporate raids; the 1980s were also a time of groundbreaking theoretical advances in financial economics, a specialty that concentrates on trading, pricing, hedging and risk.from his vantage point as the head of morgan stanley's pension division, mr. gold could see the lessons of financial economics being applied to everything around him -- except pensions.financial economists were concerned with accurately measuring the cost of transactions that would happen in the future. actuaries were focused on estimating pension costs and then spreading out the cost as smoothly as possible over time. their clients wanted slow, steady funding schedules that would pay for their workers' benefits over the years without surging every time the markets soured or interest rates spiked.that meant actuaries were not terribly concerned about up-to-the-minute asset values, or measuring pension obligations the way the markets would. their numbers made sense to them, but not to anyone else. they often told clients to make bigger contributions than current market conditions called for, knowing it would result in excess funding, which would fill the hole later on when the markets changed.that was why the raiders of the 1980s found troves of pension money that seemed to be just sitting there, waiting to be captured.confusion about actuarial numbers also helps explain why so many state and local governments promised valuable pensions without understanding how much it would cost to pay them.in 1995 mr. gold applied to the doctoral program at the university of pennsylvania's wharton school, saying he wanted to research how pension finance had come to be so muddled.""i would look to the principles of modern finance for guidance in the design of a more rational pension finance of the future,"" he wrote.by the time he emerged with a doctorate in financial economics, the big stock run-up of the 1990s was ending and the rich pension surpluses of the 1980s had disappeared. the baby boomers were retiring, the markets were gyrating, companies were trying to get out of the pension business, and state and local pension plans were struggling.those conditions intensified the opposition to mr. gold's calls for sweeping change, but they made him all the more certain that change was needed.mr. gold was born in brooklyn on nov. 28, 1942, to sarah and edward gold, and grew up on manhattan's lower east side. he was accepted at m.i.t. at 16 but flunked out after three years as a math major. he ultimately received a bachelor's degree from pace college (now pace university). before joining morgan stanley he worked at the consulting firms alexander and alexander and buck consultants.his two marriages ended in divorce. in addition to his son, he is survived by a brother, jonathan, and a granddaughter.jeremy gold in 2015. he was one of the first actuaries to work on wall street in an era of corporate raids and the looting of pensions, causing him to question the advice actuaries gave employers.

the 1980s were also a time of groundbreaking theoretical advances in financial economics, a specialty that concentrates on trading, pricing, hedging and risk.from his vantage point as the head of morgan stanley's pension division, mr. smith could see the lessons of financial economics being applied to everything around him -- except pensions.financial economists were concerned with accurately measuring the cost of transactions that would happen in the future. actuaries were focused on estimating pension costs and then spreading out the cost as smoothly as possible over time. their clients wanted slow, steady funding schedules that would pay for their workers' benefits over the years without surging every time the markets soured or interest rates spiked.that meant actuaries were not terribly concerned about up-to-the-minute asset values, or measuring pension obligations the way the markets would. their numbers made sense to them, but not to anyone else. they often told clients to make bigger contributions than current market conditions called for, knowing it would result in excess funding, which would fill the hole later on when the markets changed.that was why the raiders of the 1980s found troves of pension money that seemed to be just sitting there, waiting to be captured.confusion about actuarial numbers also helps explain why so many state and local governments promised valuable pensions without understanding how much it would cost to pay them.in 1995 mr. smith applied to the doctoral program at the university of pennsylvania's wharton school, saying he wanted to research how pension finance had come to be so muddled.""i would look to the principles of modern finance for guidance in the design of a more rational pension finance of the future,"" he wrote.by the time he emerged with a doctorate in financial economics, the big stock run-up of the 1990s was ending and the rich pension surpluses of the 1980s had disappeared. the baby boomers were retiring, the markets were gyrating, companies were trying to get out of the pension business, and state and local pension plans were struggling.those conditions intensified the opposition to mr. smith s calls for sweeping change, but they made him all the more certain that change was needed.mr. smith was born in brooklyn on nov. 28, 1942, to sarah and edward smith and grew up on manhattan's lower east side. he was accepted at m.i.t. at 16 but flunked out after three years as a math major. he ultimately received a bachelor's degree from pace college (now pace university). before joining morgan stanley he worked at the consulting firms alexander and alexander and buck consultants.his two marriages ended in divorce. in addition to his son, he is survived by a brother, jonathan, and a granddaughter.jeremy smith in 2015. he was one of the first actuaries to work on wall street in an era of corporate raids and the looting of pensions, causing him to question the advice actuaries gave employers.

Obituary:
he led south africa’s largest ethnic group through decades of change and political turmoil. johannesburg — goodwill zwelithini ka bhekuzulu, the king of south africa’s zulu nation, who shepherded his people from the apartheid era into a modern democratic society, died on friday in the eastern coastal city of durban. he was 72. prince mangosuthu buthelezi, the king’s prime minister, announced the death, at inkosi albert luthuli hospital. he did not state a cause. king zwelithini was admitted there last month to be treated for diabetes. born on july 14, 1948, he was the eighth monarch of the zulu nation, south africa’s largest ethnic group, and a direct descendant of the zulu warrior kings who fought against colonial rule. the eldest son of king cyprian bhekuzulu ka solomon and his second wife, queen thomozile jezangani ka ndwandwe, he was educated at the bekezulu college of chiefs and then privately tutored at the khethomthandayo royal palace. he was crowned in 1971, three years after the death of his father; subsequent assassination attempts had forced him into hiding. when he was able to take the throne, his role was largely ceremonial as head of a quasi-independent homeland under the apartheid government. still, king zwelithini tried to assert himself politically, clashing with mr. buthelezi, who is also his cousin and who at the time was the government-appointed administrator of the kwazulu homeland. in 1979, king zwelithini tried to form his own political party to challenge mr. buthelezi, but he was sanctioned, and his salary was cut. the two men later reconciled, with the king throwing his weight behind mr. buthelezi’s political party. during the 1980s and ’90s, as violence in the kwazulu region threatened to upend south africa’s transition to democracy, the king was at times a voice of peace and dissent in the negotiations. he sparred with the leaders of the african national congress, which would become the governing party in post-apartheid south africa, over sanctions against the apartheid government. he also called for an end to the bloodshed that nearly plunged south africa into civil war as supporters of the a.n.c. and mr. buthelezi’s inkatha freedom party clashed ahead of the pivotal 1994 election. the king was instrumental in securing recognition of south africa’s royal houses as the new constitution was written. this was largely seen as a concession by nelson mandela, who became president in 1994, and the a.n.c. after the king had threatened to boycott the election. afterward, as the traditional leader of nearly 20 percent of south africa’s population, king zwelithini maintained political influence, with subsequent presidents and political leaders showing deference to him. at times his utterances caused upheaval, as in 2015, when his remarks about “foreign nationals” led to xenophobic violence in which at least seven people were killed. “we ask foreign nationals to pack their belongings and go back to their countries,” the king said at a rally in durban. he later condemned the violence, saying his comments about migrant workers and joblessness among south africans had been taken out of context. king zwelithini, who as the zulu leader was allocated the largest share of a compensation fund that the government sets aside for south africa’s traditional leaders, was one of the country’s largest landowners. he opposed plans to nationalize and redistribute land. for many, he was a living symbol of zulu history and a link between the nation that fought british colonialism and a people who maintained their language and culture in a post-apartheid south africa. “the king was the voice of reason, and it’s important that no matter what the political changes, he was a constant that rose above,” said mkhuleko hlengwa, the 33-year-old spokesman for the inkatha freedom party. “we are zulu regardless of who is in government.” it is not yet certain who will succeed the king. his eldest son, lethukuthula zulu, 50, was murdered in his home in johannesburg in november, and five people have been charged. king zwelithini is survived by six wives and 26 children.",2021-03-12,"Date: 2021-03-12

Obituary:
george s. irving, a tony award-winning actor who was in the original broadway casts of “oklahoma!” and “gentlemen prefer blondes” and amused a wide audience pitching white owl cigars on television, died on monday in manhattan. he was 94. his daughter, katherine irving, said the cause was heart failure. with his jutting jaw, wavy hair, commanding size and operatic baritone voice, mr. irving was a formidable stage presence. “he didn’t need a microphone,” said james morgan, the producing artistic director of the york theater, an off broadway company where mr. irving reprised some of his roles in decades-old, short-lived broadway musicals. “he had this incredibly resonant voice, and total precision of diction. you can hear him on recordings — his voice just pops out from everybody else.” in one of those shows, “enter laughing,” in 2008, mr. irving revived the ridiculous, ribald number “the butler’s song ” from “so long, 174th street,” as the musical was known when it closed after 16 performances in 1976. he showed anew the crispness of his enunciation — in this case stretched to farcical parody — and his talent for broad comedy. george irving shelasky was born on nov. 1, 1922, in springfield, mass., to abraham shelasky, a haberdasher, and the former rebecca sack, a homemaker. “when i was 13 or 14, i sang in synagogues and churches when i was a boy soprano,” mr. irving told the theater website broadway world . “we had a very good dramatics teacher in high school. we did ‘julius caesar’ and chekhov.” after graduating from classical high school in springfield, he was awarded a scholarship to study drama at the leland powers school in boston. after a year, he said, he found chorus work at the municipal theater association of st. louis, an outdoor theater better known as the muny. when mr. irving replaced an actor in “show boat” at the muny, oscar hammerstein ii, the musical’s lyricist, happened to be there; their meeting eventually led to a job for mr. irving in the chorus of “oklahoma!” and a front-row seat for the production’s first reading. “we all gathered upstairs at the guild theater, and dick rodgers played the score for us for the first time,” he told broadway world. “oscar was there and sort of mumbled the lyrics a little.” he left after a few weeks when he was drafted into the army in world war ii. he served in special services, the military’s entertainment branch, in the philippines and korea. after his discharge, mr. irving went back to broadway and was cast in “call me mister,” a revue about soldiers returning from war. he met his future wife, maria karnilova, a ballet dancer and actress, in the cast. her portrayal of golde, tevye the dairyman’s wife, in “fiddler on the roof” earned her the tony award for best featured actress in a musical in 1965. mr. irving won his tony, for best featured actor in a musical, eight years later for “irene,” a hit revival of a 1920s show that also starred debbie reynolds, in which he played a flamboyant male fashion designer named madame lucy. ( ms. reynolds died on wednesday.) in an otherwise tepid review, clive barnes of the new york times called mr. irving’s performance “by far the most professional and polished,” and said his madame lucy “stole a show that was never guarded as closely as it might have been.” mr. irving was a regular on broadway, in the musicals “can-can,” “bells are ringing” and “irma la douce,” among others, and in plays like gore vidal’s political satire “an evening with richard nixon and...,” in which he played the title role. by the early 1970s, mr. irving’s expressive face had grown increasingly familiar to theater and television audiences. one of his long-running roles was as the spokesman for the american-made white owl cigars. once you try a white owl, he said with a cocky smile, “we’re gonna getcha. you know we’re gonna getcha.” after exhaling some smoke, he added, “oh yeah.” but he lost the job, he said, when he told esquire magazine that he was most like his character in the ad campaign “when i get my hands on a big, fat cuban cigar.” in 1974 he provided the voice for heat miser, the character who regulates warm weather, in the animated television movie “the year without a santa claus.” he returned to the role 34 years later in a sequel, “a miser brothers’ christmas.” he also narrated episodes of the “underdog” cartoon series. in addition to his daughter, mr. irving is survived by a son, alexander; three grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. ms. karnilova died in 2001. mr. irving was known for holding cast members at the york theater rapt with his decades’ worth of backstage stories. “ninety-nine percent of them aren’t printable,” josh grisetti, who worked with him in “enter laughing,” said in an interview. “he was so classy and dignified, so when he came out with those ridiculous stories or jokes, they always caught you off guard.” source url: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/obituaries/george-s-irving-tony-voice-of-heat-dies-94.html?partner=bloomberg credit: richard sandomir",2016-12-29,"Date: 2016-12-29

( ms. reynolds died on wednesday.) in an otherwise tepid review, clive barnes of the new york times called mr. smith s performance “by far the most professional and polished,” and said his madame lucy “stole a show that was never guarded as closely as it might have been.” mr. smith was a regular on broadway, in the musicals “can-can,” “bells are ringing” and “irma la douce,” among others, and in plays like gore vidal’s political satire “an evening with richard nixon and...,” in which he played the title role. by the early 1970s, mr. smith s expressive face had grown increasingly familiar to theater and television audiences. one of his long-running roles was as the spokesman for the american-made white owl cigars. once you try a white owl, he said with a cocky smile, “we’re gonna getcha. you know we’re gonna getcha.” after exhaling some smoke, he added, “oh yeah.” but he lost the job, he said, when he told esquire magazine that he was most like his character in the ad campaign “when i get my hands on a big, fat cuban cigar.” in 1974 he provided the voice for heat miser, the character who regulates warm weather, in the animated television movie “the year without a santa claus.” he returned to the role 34 years later in a sequel, “a miser brothers’ christmas.” he also narrated episodes of the “underdog” cartoon series. in addition to his daughter, mr. smith is survived by a son, alexander; three grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. ms. karnilova died in 2001. mr. smith was known for holding cast members at the york theater rapt with his decades’ worth of backstage stories. “ninety-nine percent of them aren’t printable,” josh grisetti, who worked with him in “enter laughing,” said in an interview. “he was so classy and dignified, so when he came out with those ridiculous stories or jokes, they always caught you off guard.” source url: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/obituaries/george-s-irving-tony-voice-of-heat-dies-94.html?partner=bloomberg credit: richard sandomir"

Obituary:
an undated photo provided by tachyon publications of author suzy mckee charnas. the award-winning feminist science fiction writer, who in a four-novel series created a post-holocaust, male-dominated society called the holdfast that is liberated by an army of women, died on jan. 2, 2023, at her home in albuquerque. she was 83. -- no sales; for editorial use only with nyt story obit charnas by richard sandomir for march 10, 2023. all other use prohibited. suzy mckee charnas, an award-winning feminist science fiction writer who in a four-novel series created a post-holocaust, male-dominated society called the holdfast that is liberated by an army of women, died jan. 2 at her home in albuquerque, new mexico. she was 83. david szanton, a cousin, said the cause was a heart attack. her death was not widely reported at the time. charnas, whose books were well regarded but who, by her account, did not make a living from her writing, was best known for her science fiction. but she also wrote vampire fiction, young adult fantasy novels with women as central characters, and a memoir about taking care of her father in his later years after a long period of estrangement. in an epic that began with “walk to the end of the world” (1974) and concluded 25 years later with “the conqueror’s child,” charnas conceived a dystopic world in which an escaped female slave, alldera, leads the rebellious free fems to brutally conquer and enslave their former male masters. the men had faulted women for the near-destruction of humanity, called the wasting. the holdfast chronicles, as the series is called, is unique in feminist science fiction “in that it reflects 25 years of the development of feminism,” dunja m. mohr wrote in the journal science fiction studies in 1999. “investigating the raging war of the sexes,” she added, “charnas does not shy away from describing the slow — and sometimes grim — process of change leading from dystopia to utopia, the painful purging of psychological and physical violence involved.” fantasy novelist polly shulman wrote in salon in 2000 that the holdfast chronicles “fall squarely in the tradition of feminist utopias/dystopias that produced joanna russ’ ‘the female man’ or margaret atwood’s ‘the handmaid’s tale,’ nourishing writers like ursula k. le guin and sheri s. tepper.” charnas did not set out to write a feminist novel. in an interview with snackreads, a digital publisher of short fiction, she said “walk to the end of the world” began as a satire about how top political leaders in washington would behave while confined to bunkers during a nuclear war “waiting,” as she put it, “for the results of their stupidity to wipe out the rest of the world so they could come out and repopulate it with the assistants they were sleeping with.” while the book was in progress, she described the story to a women’s consciousness-raising group in new mexico, explaining that “everybody in the foreground is male” and all the women were slaves. then she had an epiphany. “what are you doing sitting in this room, full of women, talking about women as half the population and writing this story that’s only about the guys?” she recalled telling herself. “the women in your story are there, but they don’t have a word to say. not one of them. so i went back and rewrote the whole thing, and this time i gave one of the women, alldera, a voice, and she told part of the story, and the book changed completely. it became a feminist text.” the other books in the holdfast series are “motherlines” (1978) and “the furies” (1994). “the conqueror’s child” won the 1999 james tiptree jr. award (now called the otherwise), a literary prize for works of science fiction or fantasy that explore gender. she also won two other science fiction and fantasy awards: a nebula for a novella, “unicorn tapestry,” which is a chapter in her 1980 novel, “the vampire tapestry,” and the basis for her play, “vampire dreams”; and a hugo, for “boobs,” a short story. “suzy, to me, was a lot like david bowie,” said jane lindskold, a science fiction and fantasy writer who knew charnas from a writers’ group in albuquerque. “she followed her own muse. she could have just written only vampire books, but she did what she wanted to do.” suzy mckee was born on oct. 22, 1939, in manhattan. her parents, robin and maxine (szanton) mckee, were commercial artists who worked at home but divorced when suzy was 8 years old. suzy was a voracious reader who also wrote and illustrated stories, often about cowboys. “it wasn’t that much of a step from that to making up and writing down stories intended for unfolding in other people’s heads — the first true magic i can remember encountering in my life,” charnas said in an interview with the journal science fiction studies in 1999. after graduating from barnard college in 1961 with a bachelor’s degree in economics and history — subjects she believed would help her build convincing fictional societies in her novels — she joined the peace corps, teaching in nigeria for two years before earning a master’s in teaching from new york university in 1965. she taught at a private school in manhattan for a few years before joining flower-fifth avenue hospital as a curriculum writer for a drug-treatment program in secondary schools. she married stephen charnas, a lawyer, in 1968, and soon after moved to albuquerque. charnas had been an occasional fan of science fiction but began writing in the genre only after reading le guin’s 1969 novel, “the left hand of darkness,” which explored gender themes. “the book was a mindblower,” charnas told snackreads, “not just for me, but for a lot of women, who said, ‘holy crap, look what this woman did! look what she’s talking about!’” science fiction was not the only genre she explored. in “the vampire tapestry,” she created dr. edward weyland, a vampire posing as an anthropology professor. writing in the washington post, fantasy writer elizabeth a. lynn praised the novel, saying it “works on many levels — as pure adventure, as social description, as psychological drama and as a passionate exploration of the web that links instinct, morality and culture. it is a serious, startling and revolutionary work.” director guillermo del toro, who is known for his science fiction and horror films, was an admirer of “the vampire tapestry.” he called it “flawless” on twitter in 2015 and, after charnas’ death, said, “it may be her masterpiece.” “stagestruck vampires and other phantasms” (2004), a collection of her short work, includes a story that rethinks “the phantom of the opera” and “beauty and the beast.” in another, an astronaut at a concert on a faraway planet listens to two lizards discussing the music. charnas is survived by her sisters, liza mckee and patricia powers. her husband died in 2018. her last book was “my father’s ghost: the return of my old man and other second chances” (2002), about how she and her husband brought her long-absent father — he had left her family when she was a child — to live on their property in albuquerque and her struggle to get to know him over nearly 20 years. “the person who came to live next door to me was less my father than my father’s ghost: the ghost of my father as i had known him and imagined him all my life,” she wrote. “he was also, i suspect, the ghost of the man he himself had set out to be but never became.” she added, “well, i’m a lucky devil: he was a good ghost, an instructive ghost.” this article originally appeared in the new york times.",2023-03-10,"Date: 2023-03-10

for editorial use only with nyt story obit charnas by richard sandomir for march 10, 2023. all other use prohibited. jane smith charnas, an award-winning feminist science fiction writer who in a four-novel series created a post-holocaust, male-dominated society called the holdfast that is liberated by an army of women, died jan. 2 at her home in albuquerque, new mexico. she was 83. david johnson a cousin, said the cause was a heart attack. her death was not widely reported at the time. charnas, whose books were well regarded but who, by her account, did not make a living from her writing, was best known for her science fiction. but she also wrote vampire fiction, young adult fantasy novels with women as central characters, and a memoir about taking care of her father in his later years after a long period of estrangement. in an epic that began with “walk to the end of the world” (1974) and concluded 25 years later with “the conqueror’s child,” charnas conceived a dystopic world in which an escaped female slave, alldera, leads the rebellious free fems to brutally conquer and enslave their former male masters. the men had faulted women for the near-destruction of humanity, called the wasting. the holdfast chronicles, as the series is called, is unique in feminist science fiction “in that it reflects 25 years of the development of feminism,” dunja m. mohr wrote in the journal science fiction studies in 1999. “investigating the raging war of the sexes,” she added, “charnas does not shy away from describing the slow — and sometimes grim — process of change leading from dystopia to utopia, the painful purging of psychological and physical violence involved.” fantasy novelist polly shulman wrote in salon in 2000 that the holdfast chronicles “fall squarely in the tradition of feminist utopias/dystopias that produced joanna russ’ ‘the female man’ or margaret atwood’s ‘the handmaid’s tale,’ nourishing writers like ursula k. le guin and sheri s. tepper.” charnas did not set out to write a feminist novel. in an interview with snackreads, a digital publisher of short fiction, she said “walk to the end of the world” began as a satire about how top political leaders in washington would behave while confined to bunkers during a nuclear war “waiting,” as she put it, “for the results of their stupidity to wipe out the rest of the world so they could come out and repopulate it with the assistants they were sleeping with.” while the book was in progress, she described the story to a women’s consciousness-raising group in new mexico, explaining that “everybody in the foreground is male” and all the women were slaves. then she had an epiphany. “what are you doing sitting in this room, full of women, talking about women as half the population and writing this story that’s only about the guys?” she recalled telling herself. “the women in your story are there, but they don’t have a word to say. not one of them. so i went back and rewrote the whole thing, and this time i gave one of the women, alldera, a voice, and she told part of the story, and the book changed completely. it became a feminist text.” the other books in the holdfast series are “motherlines” (1978) and “the furies” (1994). “the conqueror’s child” won the 1999 james tiptree jr. award (now called the otherwise), a literary prize for works of science fiction or fantasy that explore gender. she also won two other science fiction and fantasy awards: a nebula for a novella, “unicorn tapestry,” which is a chapter in her 1980 novel, “the vampire tapestry,” and the basis for her play, “vampire dreams”; and a hugo, for “boobs,” a short story. “suzy, to me, was a lot like david bowie,” said jane lindskold, a science fiction and fantasy writer who knew charnas from a writers’ group in albuquerque. “she followed her own muse. she could have just written only vampire books, but she did what she wanted to do.” jane smith was born on oct. 22, 1939, in manhattan. her parents, robin and maxine (szanton) smith were commercial artists who worked at home but divorced when jane was 8 years old. jane was a voracious reader who also wrote and illustrated stories, often about cowboys. “it wasn’t that much of a step from that to making up and writing down stories intended for unfolding in other people’s heads — the first true magic i can remember encountering in my life,” charnas said in an interview with the journal science fiction studies in 1999. after graduating from barnard college in 1961 with a bachelor’s degree in economics and history — subjects she believed would help her build convincing fictional societies in her novels — she joined the peace corps, teaching in nigeria for two years before earning a master’s in teaching from new york university in 1965. she taught at a private school in manhattan for a few years before joining flower-fifth avenue hospital as a curriculum writer for a drug-treatment program in secondary schools. she married stephen charnas, a lawyer, in 1968, and soon after moved to albuquerque. charnas had been an occasional fan of science fiction but began writing in the genre only after reading le guin’s 1969 novel, “the left hand of darkness,” which explored gender themes. “the book was a mindblower,” charnas told snackreads, “not just for me, but for a lot of women, who said, ‘holy crap, look what this woman did! look what she’s talking about!’” science fiction was not the only genre she explored. in “the vampire tapestry,” she created dr. edward weyland, a vampire posing as an anthropology professor. writing in the washington post, fantasy writer elizabeth a. lynn praised the novel, saying it “works on many levels — as pure adventure, as social description, as psychological drama and as a passionate exploration of the web that links instinct, morality and culture. it is a serious, startling and revolutionary work.” director guillermo del toro, who is known for his science fiction and horror films, was an admirer of “the vampire tapestry.” he called it “flawless” on twitter in 2015 and, after charnas’ death, said, “it may be her masterpiece.” “stagestruck vampires and other phantasms” (2004), a collection of her short work, includes a story that rethinks “the phantom of the opera” and “beauty and the beast.” in another, an astronaut at a concert on a faraway planet listens to two lizards discussing the music. charnas is survived by her sisters, liza smith and patricia powers. her husband died in 2018. her last book was “my father’s ghost: the return of my old man and other second chances” (2002), about how she and her husband brought her long-absent father — he had left her family when she was a child — to live on their property in albuquerque and her struggle to get to know him over nearly 20 years. “the person who came to live next door to me was less my father than my father’s ghost: the ghost of my father as i had known him and imagined him all my life,” she wrote. “he was also, i suspect, the ghost of the man he himself had set out to be but never became.” she added, “well, i’m a lucky devil: he was a good ghost, an instructive ghost.” this article originally appeared in the new york times."

Obituary title: sharon wohlmuth, photographer of best-selling ‘sisters,’ dies at 75
Obituary:
her images, paired with the words of carol saline, created a publishing sensation that led to the follow-up books “mothers and daughters” and “best friends.” sharon j. wohlmuth, a photojournalist who with the writer carol saline struck publishing gold in 1994 with “sisters,” a text-and-photo book that profiled famous and not-so-famous sets of sisters and became a runaway best seller, died on feb. 12 at her home in philadelphia. she was 75. her nephew zachary joslow confirmed the death but did not specify a cause. ms. wohlmuth was a veteran photographer at the philadelphia inquirer when she and ms. saline, a senior writer for philadelphia magazine, developed the idea that became “sisters”: ms. saline would write profiles of various sets of sisters, and ms. wohlmuth would photograph the subjects. the three dozen sets of sisters they selected included well-known figures like coretta scott king, who was featured with her sister, edythe scott bagley, but also people like bernetta and margaret crommarty, philadelphia sisters in their 80s who were struggling with health problems. some of the stories were uplifting; others told of personal hardships or strained relations. no major publisher was interested. many were kicking themselves later. “sisters” was ultimately published by running press, a small company that had been founded by ms. wohlmuth’s husband, larry teacher, and his brother, buz. in late december 1994, the book landed on the nonfiction best-seller list of the new york times. it was still there more than a year later. “sisters” ultimately stayed on the list for a remarkable 63 weeks, sold more than a million copies and spawned imitators. it also brought ms. wohlmuth and ms. saline a seven-figure contract from doubleday for two more books, “mothers and daughters” (1997) and “best friends” (1998). both also made the times’s best-seller list. with her evocative photographs — some joyous, some serene, some heartbreaking — ms. wohlmuth sought to complement and enhance ms. saline’s words. “because i’m a photojournalist, i’m always stepping back and watching for that certain moment to occur,” ms. wohlmuth told the weekly newspaper jewish exponent in 1997. “it’s not like a formal portrait. there’s got to be something else there.” capturing that meant patience. talking about “sisters” on cbs’s “the early show” in 2004, the book’s 10th anniversary, she invoked the theories of the photographer henri cartier-bresson. “you have to be quiet,” she said. “and you know what happens? they become sisters, and it’s that one moment — cartier-bresson talks about the decisive moment.” she added, “i want them to show me who they are as sisters.” sharon barbara josolowitz was born on sept. 25, 1946, in bristol, conn. her father, philip, was a merchant; her mother, rebecca (dressler) josolowitz, was a homemaker. she married edward wohlmuth in 1966; they divorced in 1974. by then she was studying photography at moore college of art and design in philadelphia. soon after she graduated in 1975, she was working at the inquirer. “sharon and i were the first and only women photographers working at the philadelphia inquirer in the late 1970s,” sara krulwich, now a photographer for the times, recalled. “she wasn’t really interested in the technical side of photojournalism, but that didn’t matter. her skill was her ability to connect with her subjects in such a real way that they would relax and open their lives to her. “she became the inquirer’s secret weapon,” ms. krulwich continued. “if a door was closed to everyone else, sharon could always manage to get in and take wonderful pictures.” her assignments for the paper covered a wide range of topics, from local political and cultural events to stories of international importance. when the nuclear power plant at three mile island near harrisburg, pa., experienced a near meltdown in 1979, she was one of three photographers dispatched to the area. the inquirer’s staff won a pulitzer prize for that coverage. two years later she was in strife-torn somalia photographing refugee camps. ms. wohlmuth and ms. saline were casual acquaintances when, at a brunch, they began chatting about sisterly bonds. ms. saline had just been given a needlepoint by her sister for her birthday that said something about being forever friends, and ms. wohlmuth had long noticed that, to her photographer’s eye, sisters gave off a particular visual vibe. running press gave them a small advance to pursue the book idea. “we spent every cent of our little advance going around the country photographing and interviewing the sisters we chose,” ms. saline said by email, “staying in the cheapest motels and ordering pizzas for dinner.” the selection process was part research, part happenstance. ms. wohlmuth, in a 1995 interview with newsday, remembered hearing a song by kate and anna mcgarrigle on her car radio and being struck by the lyrics, then heading for the nearest phone. “i had the mcgarrigles lined up the next day,” she recalled — anna, kate and their sister jane. ms. wohlmuth married mr. teacher in 1991. he died in 2014. she is survived by a brother, gary joslow; a sister, beth josolowitz; a stepdaughter, rachael teacher; and a step-grandson. the success of “sisters” landed ms. saline and ms. wohlmuth on oprah winfrey’s program and other talk shows. ms. wohlmuth said that among the most gratifying aspects of the book’s success was what she and ms. saline heard from readers. “sisters give the book to one another as on olive branch,” ms. wohlmuth told jewish exponent. “and the letters we’ve received — thank-you letters that say, ‘the book brought me and my sister together again.’”",2022-03-01,"Date: 2022-03-01

Obituary title: robert f. curl jr., nobel prize winner in chemistry, dies at 88
Obituary:
he and three others discovered unexpectedly simple carbon molecules called buckyballs (think of a soccer ball), spurring explorations of nanotechnology. robert f. curl jr., who shared the 1996 nobel prize in chemistry as one of the discoverers of remarkably simple but completely unexpected carbon molecules known as buckyballs, died on july 3 at a retirement home in houston. he was 88. his death was announced by rice university, where dr. curl was a professor emeritus of chemistry. buckyballs, with their round, hollow structure, upended chemists’ notions of what was possible for the shapes of molecules. a flood of scientists started studying them, spurring the nascent field of nanotechnology and dreams of building molecule-size machines. before buckyballs, pure carbon was known to exist in just a few configurations: stacked in sheets as graphite; arrayed in hard, clear crystals of diamond; and jumbled randomly in amorphous carbon. but in 1985, dr. curl, along with richard e. smalley, a rice colleague, and harold w. kroto, a scientist visiting from the university of sussex in england, showed a new configuration: 60 carbon atoms bonded into a molecule that resembled an old-time soccer ball. they also found a larger version made of 70 carbons. the finding was serendipitous, because they had been looking for something else. “you could argue it wasn’t any of our areas of interest,” james r. heath, a graduate student of dr. smalley’s who performed many of the buckyball experiments, said in an interview. the chemists named the molecules buckminsterfullerenes after the architect buckminster fuller and his geodesic domes. the name was later shortened to fullerenes or buckyballs. for the experiment, dr. kroto was interested in molecules containing long chains of carbon that had been observed in interstellar space. he hypothesized that the long-chain molecules were created in the atmospheres of carbon-rich red giant stars. “harry had studied these in both the laboratory and in using radio telescopes,” said dr. heath, now president of the institute for systems biology in seattle, “but they were very, very transient. and so you couldn’t get a picture of how they were made or how abundant they might be.” at a science conference in 1984, dr. kroto ran into dr. curl, an old friend. dr. curl told him about an apparatus of dr. smalley’s that used a laser to create an intensely hot vapor that coalesced into clusters. dr. kroto realized that this apparatus could create conditions similar to those in the atmosphere of a red giant. dr. smalley was less enthusiastic; vaporizing carbon would be a distraction, taking away time from the machine that might otherwise be used for the semiconductor research that he and dr. curl were pursuing. dr. smalley was even less enthusiastic after a research group at exxon in new jersey reported results of a similar experiment with a similar apparatus. but dr. smalley finally agreed to try it, and the three professors, along with dr. heath and two graduate students, started their work. they indeed discovered the long carbon chains that dr. kroto had wanted to find. they also found something else — the buckyballs. dr. heath said dr. curl provided a healthy dose of skepticism during the 11-day whirlwind of discovery. “all of us were like excitable kids,” dr. heath said. “and bob was like the adult in the room. and he would come up with reasons that we had to go back and test and make sure that this was right or that was correct. we all viewed bob not like he was a devil’s advocate — more like he was an insurance policy. if bob agreed with you, you were probably right.” it turned out that the exxon experiments had also created small numbers of buckyballs, but those researchers had overlooked them in their data. at rice, the scientists realized what they had found. “if mother nature is trying to tell you something, you have to listen,” dr. curl recalled in a 2016 rice university interview celebrating the 20th anniversary of his nobel. while dr. kroto and dr. smalley pursued further buckyball research, dr. curl soon moved on to other areas of interest. in the 2016 interview, he recalled going to dr. smalley’s office and finding his colleague filling up binders with papers about buckyballs. “i don’t want to be in any field for a full-time job keeping up with the literature,” dr. curl said. “that’s why i abandoned that area.” not many practical uses have been found for buckyballs, but other related forms, like nanotubes (rolled-up tubes of carbon) and graphene (single-atom-thick sheets of carbon) have proved promising. in 2010, nasa’s spitzer space telescope discovered buckyballs in interstellar space. in recent years, dr. curl turned to economics, working on mathematical models to study matters like energy production and automation. robert floyd curl jr. was born on aug. 23, 1933, in alice, texas. his father was a methodist minister who had helped establish the methodist hospital in san antonio. his mother, lessie, was a homemaker. “when i was 9 years old, my parents gave me a chemistry set,” dr. curl wrote in an autobiographical sketch for the nobel foundation. “within a week, i had decided to become a chemist and never wavered from that choice.” in 1954 he received a bachelor’s in chemistry at rice, then known as the rice institute. he earned his doctorate in chemistry at the university of california, berkeley. after a postdoctoral position at harvard, he returned to rice in 1958 as an assistant professor. he became a full professor in 1967. he retired in 2005, although he continued to work for years. dr. curl married jonel whipple in 1955. his survivors include his wife;

Obituary title: jean fagan yellin, who traced former slave's story, dies at 92
Obituary:
her research proved that a 19th-century book presumed to be a novel by a white woman was actually an autobiography by a formerly enslaved black woman.jean fagan yellin, a historian whose six years of sleuthing revealed that what had been presumed to be a 19th-century white author's fictional account of a young woman's life as a slave in the american south was, in fact, a rare autobiography written by a formerly enslaved woman, died on july 19 at her home in sarasota, fla. she was 92.her death was confirmed by her son, michael yellin.the author's name was harriet jacobs.""there are only a couple of names that are commonly known of 19th-century women held in slavery -- sojourner truth and harriet tubman,"" dr. yellin said during a lecture at harvard university in 2004, when she published a book about her findings, ""harriet jacobs: a life.""""both could not write, because enslaved people were subject to anti-literacy laws,"" dr. yellin added. ""their stories, in their own pens, do not exist. jacobs is it.""originally published in 1861, harriet jacobs's book, ""incidents in the life of a slave girl,"" vividly recounted her enslavement from her birth in north carolina in 1813. she was taught to read and write by the benevolent mistress whose family owned her.""though we were all slaves,"" ms. jacobs wrote, ""i was so fondly shielded that i never dreamed that i was a piece of merchandise.""she recalled that when she was 12, she fell into the hands of a sexually abusive plantation owner who, years later, would threaten to sell her children if she rebuffed his advances. her children had been fathered by another white man, who ultimately freed them. she managed to escape, hiding in a three-foot-high crawl space in her free grandmother's attic, where for seven years she read newspapers and the bible. in 1842, she fled as a fugitive to new york.while ""incidents in the life of a slave girl"" was promoted as ""written by herself,"" it was written under a pseudonym, linda brent, and was widely credited to its editor, lydia maria child, a journalist, abolitionist and advocate for women's and native american rights, who may be best remembered for writing the poem that begins, ""over the river and through the wood.""dr. yellin originally came across ""incidents in the life of a slave girl"" while writing her dissertation on 19th-century american literature, and developed a hunch that the book was autobiographical, not fiction.a letter from ms. jacobs found in the archives of smith college in northampton, mass., provided a crucial clue. the letter, which included the line ""i am sitting under the old roof 12 feet from the spot where i suffered all the crushing weight of slavery,"" mentioned the names of real people whom dr. yellin could match with the characters in ""incidents.""dr. yellin's biography of ms. jacobs delves into the accuracy of her account.once ms. jacobs reached new york, she worked as a child nurse for the family of the writer nathaniel parker willis. she was still considered a fugitive, though, threatened with recapture, until mr. willis's second wife bought her freedom from her owner's son-in-law for $300 in 1852.""the freedom i had before the money was paid was dearer to me,"" ms. jacobs wrote. ""god gave me that freedom.""she was reluctant to write her memoir until amy post, an abolitionist from upstate new york, persuaded her.""if it would help save another from my fate,"" ms. jacobs wrote to ms. post, ""it would be selfish and un-christian of me to keep it back.""as an abolitionist and a crusader for women's rights, ms. jacobs conducted relief missions for enslaved people who had fled behind union lines in virginia. she also ran a boardinghouse near harvard from 1869 to 1873.in 1877 she moved to washington, where she encountered the destitute widow and children of her former owner and abuser. before ms. jacobs died there in 1897, she helped support them.""her life in freedom was as extraordinary as her life had been in slavery and as a fugitive,"" dr. yellin said in the harvard lecture.henry louis gates jr. noted in the new york times book review in 1987 that by the end of the 1860s, only a handful of black women had published their memoirs.""the fate of jacobs's text -- its loss and rediscovery -- makes it an emblem of the history of the black woman's literary tradition,"" he wrote, adding that ""few instances of scholarly inquiry have been more important to afro-american studies than has ms. yellin's.""jean fagan was born on sept. 19, 1930, in east lansing, mich. her father, peter fagan, the son of a quaker and an irish catholic, was a marxist journalist who, with his wife, sarah (robinson) fagan, the daughter of orthodox jews and a phi beta kappa graduate of the university of michigan, published a weekly pro-labor newspaper.she received a bachelor's degree from roosevelt university in 1951 and a master's and doctorate from the university of illinois in 1963 and 1969. she began teaching at pace university (known as pace college at the time) in 1968 and was an emeritus professor of english there at her death.she married edward yellin, a biomedical engineer, in 1948; he died in 2020. together, they wrote ""in contempt: defending free speech, defeating huac"" (2022), about mr. yellin's refusal to testify in 1958 about his communist party membership before the house un-american activities committee, which was investigating soviet subversion.in addition to her son, dr. yellin is survived by a daughter, lisa yellin tebo; four grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren. another son, peter, died years earlier.other books she wrote or edited include ""women and sisters: the anti-slavery feminists in american culture"" (1990) and ""the abolitionist sisterhood: anti-slavery and women's political culture in antebellum america"" (1994, with john c. van horne).dr. yellin's biography of ms. jacobs won the frederick douglass prize and the modern language association's william sanders scarborough prize. she received a fellowship from the new york public library's schomburg center for research in black culture.she also helped establish the harriet jacobs papers project, a collection of nearly a thousand documents, more than 300 of which have since been published and are believed to be the only existing papers by a formerly enslaved black woman.""harriet jacobs: a life,"" won dr. yellin the frederick douglass prize in 2004.; ""incidents in the life of a slave girl"" was originally published by ms. jacobs in 1861.

her research proved that a 19th-century book presumed to be a novel by a white woman was actually an autobiography by a formerly enslaved black woman.jean smith johnson a historian whose six years of sleuthing revealed that what had been presumed to be a 19th-century white author's fictional account of a young woman's life as a slave in the american south was, in fact, a rare autobiography written by a formerly enslaved woman, died on july 19 at her home in sarasota, fla. she was 92.her death was confirmed by her son, michael johnson the author's name was harriet jacobs.""there are only a couple of names that are commonly known of 19th-century women held in slavery -- sojourner truth and harriet tubman,"" dr. johnson said during a lecture at harvard university in 2004, when she published a book about her findings, ""harriet jacobs: a life.""""both could not write, because enslaved people were subject to anti-literacy laws,"" dr. johnson added. ""their stories, in their own pens, do not exist. jacobs is it.""originally published in 1861, harriet jacobs's book, ""incidents in the life of a slave girl,"" vividly recounted her enslavement from her birth in north carolina in 1813. she was taught to read and write by the benevolent mistress whose family owned her.""though we were all slaves,"" ms. jacobs wrote, ""i was so fondly shielded that i never dreamed that i was a piece of merchandise.""she recalled that when she was 12, she fell into the hands of a sexually abusive plantation owner who, years later, would threaten to sell her children if she rebuffed his advances. her children had been fathered by another white man, who ultimately freed them. she managed to escape, hiding in a three-foot-high crawl space in her free grandmother's attic, where for seven years she read newspapers and the bible. in 1842, she fled as a fugitive to new york.while ""incidents in the life of a slave girl"" was promoted as ""written by herself,"" it was written under a pseudonym, linda brent, and was widely credited to its editor, lydia maria child, a journalist, abolitionist and advocate for women's and native american rights, who may be best remembered for writing the poem that begins, ""over the river and through the wood.""dr. johnson originally came across ""incidents in the life of a slave girl"" while writing her dissertation on 19th-century american literature, and developed a hunch that the book was autobiographical, not fiction.a letter from ms. jacobs found in the archives of smith college in northampton, mass., provided a crucial clue. the letter, which included the line ""i am sitting under the old roof 12 feet from the spot where i suffered all the crushing weight of slavery,"" mentioned the names of real people whom dr. johnson could match with the characters in ""incidents.""dr. johnson s biography of ms. jacobs delves into the accuracy of her account.once ms. jacobs reached new york, she worked as a child nurse for the family of the writer nathaniel parker willis. she was still considered a fugitive, though, threatened with recapture, until mr. willis's second wife bought her freedom from her owner's son-in-law for $300 in 1852.""the freedom i had before the money was paid was dearer to me,"" ms. jacobs wrote. ""god gave me that freedom.""she was reluctant to write her memoir until amy post, an abolitionist from upstate new york, persuaded her.""if it would help save another from my fate,"" ms. jacobs wrote to ms. post, ""it would be selfish and un-christian of me to keep it back.""as an abolitionist and a crusader for women's rights, ms. jacobs conducted relief missions for enslaved people who had fled behind union lines in virginia. she also ran a boardinghouse near harvard from 1869 to 1873.in 1877 she moved to washington, where she encountered the destitute widow and children of her former owner and abuser. before ms. jacobs died there in 1897, she helped support them.""her life in freedom was as extraordinary as her life had been in slavery and as a fugitive,"" dr. johnson said in the harvard lecture.henry louis gates jr. noted in the new york times book review in 1987 that by the end of the 1860s, only a handful of black women had published their memoirs.""the fate of jacobs's text -- its loss and rediscovery -- makes it an emblem of the history of the black woman's literary tradition,"" he wrote, adding that ""few instances of scholarly inquiry have been more important to afro-american studies than has ms. johnson s.""jean smith was born on sept. 19, 1930, in east lansing, mich. her father, peter smith the son of a quaker and an irish catholic, was a marxist journalist who, with his wife, sarah (robinson) smith the daughter of orthodox jews and a phi beta kappa graduate of the university of michigan, published a weekly pro-labor newspaper.she received a bachelor's degree from roosevelt university in 1951 and a master's and doctorate from the university of illinois in 1963 and 1969. she began teaching at pace university (known as pace college at the time) in 1968 and was an emeritus professor of english there at her death.she married edward johnson a biomedical engineer, in 1948; he died in 2020. together, they wrote ""in contempt: defending free speech, defeating huac"" (2022), about mr. johnson s refusal to testify in 1958 about his communist party membership before the house un-american activities committee, which was investigating soviet subversion.in addition to her son, dr. johnson is survived by a daughter, lisa johnson tebo; four grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren. another son, peter, died years earlier.other books she wrote or edited include ""women and sisters: the anti-slavery feminists in american culture"" (1990) and ""the abolitionist sisterhood: anti-slavery and women's political culture in antebellum america"" (1994, with john c. van horne).dr. johnson s biography of ms. jacobs won the frederick douglass prize and the modern language association's william sanders scarborough prize. she received a fellowship from the new york public library's schomburg center for research in black culture.she also helped establish the harriet jacobs papers project, a collection of nearly a thousand documents, more than 300 of which have since been published and are believed to be the only existing papers by a formerly enslaved black woman.""harriet jacobs: a life,"" won dr. johnson the frederick douglass prize in 2004.; ""incidents in the life of a slave girl"" was originally published by ms. jacobs in 1861.

Obituary title: paul t. kwami, fisk jubilee singers’ longtime director, dies at 70
Obituary:
file — paul t. kwami at fisk university in nashville, tenn., sept. 28, 2021. kwami, the longtime director of the fisk jubilee singers, who cemented the ensemble’s reputation as one of the country’s premier interpreters of african american spiritual music, died on saturday, sept. 10, 2022, in nashville. he was 70. (william deshazer/the new york times) paul t. kwami, the longtime director of the fisk jubilee singers, who cemented the ensemble’s reputation as one of the country’s premier interpreters of african american spiritual music, died saturday in nashville, tennessee. he was 70. his wife, susanna kwami, confirmed the death, in a hospital, but did not provide a cause. the fisk jubilee singers put nashville on the musical map long before the city became famous for its honky-tonks and slide guitars. the group, based at fisk university, a historically black institution that was founded a year after the civil war, was originally intended as a fundraising tool; it toured the country in the 1870s to bring in money for the struggling college. the group, many of whose members were formerly enslaved people, was among the first to perform spirituals like “go down moses” and “wade in the water,” songs that many white audiences had never heard, especially in the north. their first tour, in 1871, earned enough money to retire the school’s debt, pay for a 40-acre parcel of land north of downtown nashville and erect the school’s first permanent building, jubilee hall. they sang for president ulysses s. grant at the white house and performed for six weeks in new york city. “they used the power and beauty of their music, and the beauty of their singing, to win the love of people,” paul kwami said in a radio interview in february. a native of ghana and a fisk graduate, kwami continued that tradition when he took over as the group’s music director in 1994. he insisted that the singers — eight men and eight women, all fisk undergraduates — keep to a rigorous rehearsal and touring schedule. he also made sure that they understood not just the history of fisk and its musical heritage, but the roots of the songs they sang. spirituals, he told them, played many roles in slave communities. they could be lamentations or celebrations; at the same time, they could serve as a means of stealthy communication, spreading news outside the ken of white slavers. “he made us understand the language of love that was in the middle of those spirituals,” michangelo scruggs, who was a jubilee singer from 1993 to 1996, said in a phone interview. “a spiritual is not just a song. it’s a communication. it talks about the struggles and how slaves were able to overcome their struggles, whether it was through the end of slavery or whether it was even through death.” kwami also impressed upon his students the african roots of the music they sang. in 2007, he took the fisk jubilee singers to ghana to perform during the 50th anniversary of the country’s independence; while there, they visited the grave of black sociologist and activist w.e.b. du bois, who was also a fisk graduate. under kwami’s direction, the jubilee singers recorded several albums and also appeared on albums by other artists, some of them outside the group’s usual gospel and spiritual fare. they were featured alongside neil young in “heart of gold,” a 2006 concert documentary directed by jonathan demme and recorded at the renowned ryman auditorium in downtown nashville, where the singers performed regularly. “reverence was a huge thing for him, but in that reverence he was open to going into places that the group had never gone before,” ruby amanfu, a nashville-based singer and kwami’s niece, said in an interview. in 2000, the fisk jubilee singers were inducted into the gospel hall of fame. in 2008, kwami appeared on the group’s behalf at the white house to receive the national medal of arts, the country’s highest award for cultural achievement. in 2020, the fisk jubilee singers released “celebrating fisk!,” an album of 12 songs recorded at the ryman featuring guest appearances by musicians such as amanfu, keb’ mo’ and lee ann womack. it won the group its first grammy award, for best roots gospel album. that year, kwami told npr: “when i remember the life stories of the original fisk jubilee singers, some of whom were slaves, some who did not know their parents and yet left this rich legacy for us, if they were to come back today, i am sure they will be very happy that we are still singing the negro spirituals and also still talking about them.” paul theophilus kwami was born march 14, 1952, in amedzofe, a small ghanaian mountain town about 100 miles northeast of the country’s capital, accra. his father, theophilus kwami, was a music teacher and a farmer; his mother, monica rosaline (dikro) kwami, raised him and his six siblings. when paul wasn’t picking coffee on his family plantation, he was sitting with his father at his piano, learning the basics of music theory. he decided to follow his father into music education, studying for two years at a teachers college; in 1982, he received a bachelor’s degree in music education at the national academy of music in ghana. he returned home to teach and play the organ at his local church, but a chance encounter with a missionary from the united states introduced him to the idea of continuing his education at fisk. although he had grown up listening to gospel music on the radio, he had never heard of the university or its heralded singing group. he left his job and family in ghana and moved to nashville, with the intention of rounding out his education and then returning home. instead, a friend persuaded him to join the jubilee singers, who were under the direction of his mentor at the time, mccoy ransom. he stayed in the united states after graduating from fisk with a second bachelor’s degree, also in musical education, in 1985. he received a master’s degree in the same subject from western michigan university in 1987, then worked for a music publishing company in nashville before returning to fisk, and the jubilee singers, in 1994. he received a doctorate from the american conservatory of music in 2009. along with his wife, kwami is survived by his daughter, rachel kwami;

Obituary:
file — john t. smith at fisk university in nashville, tenn., sept. 28, 2021. smith the longtime director of the fisk jubilee singers, who cemented the ensemble’s reputation as one of the country’s premier interpreters of african american spiritual music, died on saturday, sept. 10, 2022, in nashville. he was 70. (william deshazer/the new york times) john t. smith the longtime director of the fisk jubilee singers, who cemented the ensemble’s reputation as one of the country’s premier interpreters of african american spiritual music, died saturday in nashville, tennessee. he was 70. his wife, susanna smith confirmed the death, in a hospital, but did not provide a cause. the fisk jubilee singers put nashville on the musical map long before the city became famous for its honky-tonks and slide guitars. the group, based at fisk university, a historically black institution that was founded a year after the civil war, was originally intended as a fundraising tool; it toured the country in the 1870s to bring in money for the struggling college. the group, many of whose members were formerly enslaved people, was among the first to perform spirituals like “go down moses” and “wade in the water,” songs that many white audiences had never heard, especially in the north. their first tour, in 1871, earned enough money to retire the school’s debt, pay for a 40-acre parcel of land north of downtown nashville and erect the school’s first permanent building, jubilee hall. they sang for president ulysses s. grant at the white house and performed for six weeks in new york city. “they used the power and beauty of their music, and the beauty of their singing, to win the love of people,” john smith said in a radio interview in february. a native of ghana and a fisk graduate, smith continued that tradition when he took over as the group’s music director in 1994. he insisted that the singers — eight men and eight women, all fisk undergraduates — keep to a rigorous rehearsal and touring schedule. he also made sure that they understood not just the history of fisk and its musical heritage, but the roots of the songs they sang. spirituals, he told them, played many roles in slave communities. they could be lamentations or celebrations; at the same time, they could serve as a means of stealthy communication, spreading news outside the ken of white slavers. “he made us understand the language of love that was in the middle of those spirituals,” michangelo scruggs, who was a jubilee singer from 1993 to 1996, said in a phone interview. “a spiritual is not just a song. it’s a communication. it talks about the struggles and how slaves were able to overcome their struggles, whether it was through the end of slavery or whether it was even through death.” smith also impressed upon his students the african roots of the music they sang. in 2007, he took the fisk jubilee singers to ghana to perform during the 50th anniversary of the country’s independence; while there, they visited the grave of black sociologist and activist w.e.b. du bois, who was also a fisk graduate. under smith s direction, the jubilee singers recorded several albums and also appeared on albums by other artists, some of them outside the group’s usual gospel and spiritual fare. they were featured alongside neil young in “heart of gold,” a 2006 concert documentary directed by jonathan demme and recorded at the renowned ryman auditorium in downtown nashville, where the singers performed regularly. “reverence was a huge thing for him, but in that reverence he was open to going into places that the group had never gone before,” ruby amanfu, a nashville-based singer and smith s niece, said in an interview. in 2000, the fisk jubilee singers were inducted into the gospel hall of fame. in 2008, smith appeared on the group’s behalf at the white house to receive the national medal of arts, the country’s highest award for cultural achievement. in 2020, the fisk jubilee singers released “celebrating fisk!,” an album of 12 songs recorded at the ryman featuring guest appearances by musicians such as amanfu, keb’ mo’ and lee ann womack. it won the group its first grammy award, for best roots gospel album. that year, smith told npr: “when i remember the life stories of the original fisk jubilee singers, some of whom were slaves, some who did not know their parents and yet left this rich legacy for us, if they were to come back today, i am sure they will be very happy that we are still singing the negro spirituals and also still talking about them.” john michael smith was born march 14, 1952, in amedzofe, a small ghanaian mountain town about 100 miles northeast of the country’s capital, accra. his father, michael smith was a music teacher and a farmer; his mother, monica rosaline (dikro) smith raised him and his six siblings. when john wasn’t picking coffee on his family plantation, he was sitting with his father at his piano, learning the basics of music theory. he decided to follow his father into music education, studying for two years at a teachers college; in 1982, he received a bachelor’s degree in music education at the national academy of music in ghana. he returned home to teach and play the organ at his local church, but a chance encounter with a missionary from the united states introduced him to the idea of continuing his education at fisk. although he had grown up listening to gospel music on the radio, he had never heard of the university or its heralded singing group. he left his job and family in ghana and moved to nashville, with the intention of rounding out his education and then returning home. instead, a friend persuaded him to join the jubilee singers, who were under the direction of his mentor at the time, mccoy ransom. he stayed in the united states after graduating from fisk with a second bachelor’s degree, also in musical education, in 1985. he received a master’s degree in the same subject from western michigan university in 1987, then worked for a music publishing company in nashville before returning to fisk, and the jubilee singers, in 1994. he received a doctorate from the american conservatory of music in 2009. along with his wife, smith is survived by his daughter, rachel smith his sons, john e. smith and delali smith his sisters, ruby f. smith patricia s. smith and joan a. smith and his brother, dickson k. smith this article originally appeared in the new york times. file — john t. smith at fisk university in nashville, tenn., sept. 28, 2021. smith the longtime director of the fisk jubilee singers, who cemented the ensemble’s reputation as one of the country’s premier interpreters of african american spiritual music, died on saturday, sept. 10, 2022, in nashville. he was 70.

Obituary:
file — anne rice at home in la jolla, calif., oct. 18, 2005. rice, the gothic novelist best known for her best-selling book “interview with the vampire,” died on saturday, dec. 11, 2021. she was 80. (stephanie diani/the new york times) anne rice, the gothic novelist best known for “interview with the vampire,” the 1976 book that in 1994 became a popular film starring tom cruise and brad pitt, died saturday. she was 80. her son, christopher rice, wrote on social media that the cause was complications from a stroke. his post did not say where she died. anne rice was a largely unknown writer when she turned a short story she had written in the late 1960s into “interview with the vampire,” her first published novel. it features a solitary vampire named louis who is telling his life story to a reporter, but rice said the tale was her story as well. “i really got into the character,’‘ she told the new york times in 1988. “for the first time, i was able to describe my reality, the dark, gothic influence on my childhood. it’s not fantasy for me. my childhood came to life for me.” many critics gave the book short shrift, seeming not to grasp either its tone or its appeal. “the publicity tells us rice is ‘a dazzling storyteller,’ ” leo braudy wrote in the times. “but there is no story here, only a series of sometimes effective but always essentially static tableaus out of roger corman films, and some self‐conscious soliloquizing out of spiderman comics, all wrapped in a ballooning, pompous language.” the reading public, though, latched on; “interview with the vampire” became a bestseller, and rice found herself with a considerable fan base, which she proceeded to entertain with a series of follow-up novels that became known collectively as the vampire chronicles. the books, more than a dozen in all, are widely credited with fueling a revival of interest in all things vampiric, which has been reflected on the big and small screens as well as onstage ever since. but rice, who wrote dozens of books in all, was not a one-subject novelist. she wrote free-standing novels like “cry to heaven” (1982), about the careers of two castrati. under the name anne rampling, she wrote steamy novels including “exit to eden” (1985), which featured sex slaves. and as a.n. roquelaure, she wrote an erotic series known as the “sleeping beauty” novels. rice’s fans are nothing if not passionate, willing to immerse themselves in the worlds she created. “when i go to my signings,” she told abc news program “day one” in 1993, “i’m the most boring person there. everybody else is dripping with velvet and lace, and bringing me dead roses wrapped in leather handcuffs, and i love it.” her books resonated not only with fans of gothic romance but also with readers who found a spiritual element in them, some gay and transgender readers who identified with their themes of isolation and alienation, and other groups. critics may have been dismissive of her writing, but she aspired to more. “what matters to me is that people know that my books are serious and that they are meant to make a difference and that they are meant to be literature,” she told the times in 1990. “whether that’s stupid or pretentious-sounding, i don’t care. they are meant to be in those backpacks on the berkeley campus, along with castaneda and tolstoy and anybody else. when i get dismissed as a ‘pop’ writer i go crazy.” howard allen o’brien was born oct. 4, 1941, in new orleans to howard and katherine o’brien. (oddly, she had been named after her father; by the time she was in first grade she had adopted “anne.”) her father worked for the postal service, and her mother was a homemaker. she grew up in new orleans, writing plays that she and her three sisters would perform and imagining ghostly figures in the windows of the new orleans mansions she would stroll past. movies like “dracula’s daughter” (1936) made a vivid impression. so did her roman catholic upbringing and education, full of imagery that played to her already vivid imagination. “to sit and listen to the miracles that happened to this saint or that saint, or how somebody floated up in the air during prayer, i mean, that was just the normal fare in catholic school,” she said. when she was 15 her mother died; she said she believed the cause was alcoholism, something rice would struggle with later, although in a 2008 video she said she had been sober for 28 years. by her late teens, she had become disillusioned with the catholic faith. “i have a great deal of anger against a church that would teach kids a 7-year-old could burn in hell for french kissing, right alongside a nazi sadist,” she told the times in 1988. in the late 1990s, though, she would return to a belief in god after decades of atheism; over the next several years she wrote two novels inspired by the life of jesus, as well as a memoir, “called out of darkness: a spiritual journey” (2008). her father remarried and moved the family to texas, where in high school rice first met stan rice, a fellow student. she attended texas woman’s university for a time but dropped out and tried living in the haight-ashbury district of san francisco. she had made an impression on stan rice in high school, and he sought her out; they began an intense correspondence, and eventually he proposed by mail. they married in 1961 and settled in san francisco, where stan rice, who died in 2002, became a poet and teacher. anne rice earned a degree at san francisco state university, though in political science, not literature — “i was a poor reader,” she wrote in her memoir, “and, in fact, couldn’t major in english because i could not read the amounts of chaucer or shakespeare assigned in the classes.” (later, though, she would earn a master’s degree in creative writing there.) a pivotal event for the couple occurred in 1972, when their daughter, michelle, died of leukemia at the age of 5. rice said the loss left her bereft and directionless for a time, until she tried returning to writing to shake off the melancholy. “i wanted to write and write and write, and pour out my emotions, and make stories, and create something,” she told abc in the 1993 interview. “that was my response to seeing something die and something pass out of my hands like that, and seeing this beautiful child die, no matter what i did or anybody else did.” “interview with the vampire” — which includes a young girl who resembles michelle — was the result. she followed up that book with “the vampire lestat” (1985), “the queen of the damned” (1988) and others in the vampire chronicles series. the latest, “blood communion,” was published in 2018. a full list of rice’s survivors was not immediately available. in the 1993 interview with abc, rice said part of her fascination with vampires as a literary device was that they could be seen as a metaphor for the human condition. “because,” as she put it, “all of us make ruthless compromises in order to live, don’t you think?” she perhaps had a vampiric side herself. “i want to be loved and never forgotten,” she said. “i’m really greedy, you know? i want to be immortal.” this article originally appeared in the new york times. file — anne rice at home in la jolla, calif., oct. 18, 2005. rice, the gothic novelist best known for her best-selling book “interview with the vampire,” died on saturday, dec. 11, 2021. she was 80.

file — jane smith at home in la jolla, calif., oct. 18, 2005. smith the gothic novelist best known for her best-selling book “interview with the vampire,” died on saturday, dec. 11, 2021. she was 80. (stephanie diani/the new york times) jane smith the gothic novelist best known for “interview with the vampire,” the 1976 book that in 1994 became a popular film starring tom cruise and brad pitt, died saturday. she was 80. her son, christopher smith wrote on social media that the cause was complications from a stroke. his post did not say where she died. jane smith was a largely unknown writer when she turned a short story she had written in the late 1960s into “interview with the vampire,” her first published novel. it features a solitary vampire named louis who is telling his life story to a reporter, but smith said the tale was her story as well. “i really got into the character,’‘ she told the new york times in 1988. “for the first time, i was able to describe my reality, the dark, gothic influence on my childhood. it’s not fantasy for me. my childhood came to life for me.” many critics gave the book short shrift, seeming not to grasp either its tone or its appeal. “the publicity tells us smith is ‘a dazzling storyteller,’ ” leo braudy wrote in the times. “but there is no story here, only a series of sometimes effective but always essentially static tableaus out of roger corman films, and some self‐conscious soliloquizing out of spiderman comics, all wrapped in a ballooning, pompous language.” the reading public, though, latched on; “interview with the vampire” became a bestseller, and smith found herself with a considerable fan base, which she proceeded to entertain with a series of follow-up novels that became known collectively as the vampire chronicles. the books, more than a dozen in all, are widely credited with fueling a revival of interest in all things vampiric, which has been reflected on the big and small screens as well as onstage ever since. but smith who wrote dozens of books in all, was not a one-subject novelist. she wrote free-standing novels like “cry to heaven” (1982), about the careers of two castrati. under the name jane rampling, she wrote steamy novels including “exit to eden” (1985), which featured sex slaves. and as a.n. roquelaure, she wrote an erotic series known as the “sleeping beauty” novels. smith s fans are nothing if not passionate, willing to immerse themselves in the worlds she created. “when i go to my signings,” she told abc news program “day one” in 1993, “i’m the most boring person there. everybody else is dripping with velvet and lace, and bringing me dead roses wrapped in leather handcuffs, and i love it.” her books resonated not only with fans of gothic romance but also with readers who found a spiritual element in them, some gay and transgender readers who identified with their themes of isolation and alienation, and other groups. critics may have been dismissive of her writing, but she aspired to more. “what matters to me is that people know that my books are serious and that they are meant to make a difference and that they are meant to be literature,” she told the times in 1990. “whether that’s stupid or pretentious-sounding, i don’t care. they are meant to be in those backpacks on the berkeley campus, along with castaneda and tolstoy and anybody else. when i get dismissed as a ‘pop’ writer i go crazy.” howard allen o’brien was born oct. 4, 1941, in new orleans to howard and katherine o’brien. (oddly, she had been named after her father; by the time she was in first grade she had adopted “anne.”) her father worked for the postal service, and her mother was a homemaker. she grew up in new orleans, writing plays that she and her three sisters would perform and imagining ghostly figures in the windows of the new orleans mansions she would stroll past. movies like “dracula’s daughter” (1936) made a vivid impression. so did her roman catholic upbringing and education, full of imagery that played to her already vivid imagination. “to sit and listen to the miracles that happened to this saint or that saint, or how somebody floated up in the air during prayer, i mean, that was just the normal fare in catholic school,” she said. when she was 15 her mother died; she said she believed the cause was alcoholism, something smith would struggle with later, although in a 2008 video she said she had been sober for 28 years. by her late teens, she had become disillusioned with the catholic faith. “i have a great deal of anger against a church that would teach kids a 7-year-old could burn in hell for french kissing, right alongside a nazi sadist,” she told the times in 1988. in the late 1990s, though, she would return to a belief in god after decades of atheism; over the next several years she wrote two novels inspired by the life of jesus, as well as a memoir, “called out of darkness: a spiritual journey” (2008). her father remarried and moved the family to texas, where in high school smith first met stan smith a fellow student. she attended texas woman’s university for a time but dropped out and tried living in the haight-ashbury district of san francisco. she had made an impression on stan smith in high school, and he sought her out; they began an intense correspondence, and eventually he proposed by mail. they married in 1961 and settled in san francisco, where stan smith who died in 2002, became a poet and teacher. jane smith earned a degree at san francisco state university, though in political science, not literature — “i was a poor reader,” she wrote in her memoir, “and, in fact, couldn’t major in english because i could not read the amounts of chaucer or shakespeare assigned in the classes.” (later, though, she would earn a master’s degree in creative writing there.) a pivotal event for the couple occurred in 1972, when their daughter, michelle, died of leukemia at the age of 5. smith said the loss left her bereft and directionless for a time, until she tried returning to writing to shake off the melancholy. “i wanted to write and write and write, and pour out my emotions, and make stories, and create something,” she told abc in the 1993 interview. “that was my response to seeing something die and something pass out of my hands like that, and seeing this beautiful child die, no matter what i did or anybody else did.” “interview with the vampire” — which includes a young girl who resembles michelle — was the result. she followed up that book with “the vampire lestat” (1985), “the queen of the damned” (1988) and others in the vampire chronicles series. the latest, “blood communion,” was published in 2018. a full list of smith s survivors was not immediately available. in the 1993 interview with abc, smith said part of her fascination with vampires as a literary device was that they could be seen as a metaphor for the human condition. “because,” as she put it, “all of us make ruthless compromises in order to live, don’t you think?” she perhaps had a vampiric side herself. “i want to be loved and never forgotten,” she said. “i’m really greedy, you know? i want to be immortal.” this article originally appeared in the new york times. file — jane smith at home in la jolla, calif., oct. 18, 2005. smith the gothic novelist best known for her best-selling book “interview with the vampire,” died on saturday, dec. 11, 2021. she was 80.

Obituary title: victoria ruvolo, 59, hailed for forgiving the teenager who attacked her, is dead
Obituary:

Obituary title: suso cecchi d’amico, writer of literate screenplays, dies at 96
Obituary:
suso cecchi d’amico, whose spare, literate screenplays made her a favored collaborator for directors including vittorio de sica, michelangelo antonioni, luchino visconti and mario monicelli, died on saturday in rome. she was 96. her death was reported by the italian news agency ansa. mrs. d’amico, a translator of english literary texts, took up screenwriting at the end of world war ii and put her stamp on the documentary style of storytelling that became known as neorealism. with de sica and cesare zavattini, she wrote “the bicycle thief,” one of the landmarks of postwar italian cinema. equally at ease writing for comic and dramatic films, she went on to write or contribute to the screenplays for visconti’s “rocco and his brothers” and monicelli’s “big deal on madonna street.” she maintained a decadeslong collaboration with visconti, starting with “bellissima” in 1951. she wrote screenplays  including for “senso,” “the leopard” and “the innocent”  for all but two of his films. on occasion, hollywood beckoned. the director william wyler hired her and the screenwriter ennio flaiano to introduce some badly needed italian atmosphere into ben hecht’s script for “roman holiday.” the experience simply reinforced her commitment to italian film. her work on monicelli’s “casanova 70” (1965) earned hollywood points when the screenplay was nominated for an academy award. “her record was astounding,” said carlo celli, the co-author of “a new guide to italian cinema” and a professor of italian and film studies at bowling green state university in ohio. “she worked with absolutely everybody and in all genres: high-art cinema, popular cinema, comedies, dramas, mafia films. and the eminent directors she worked with hit their high points with her as a screenwriter.” giovanna cecchi was born on july 21, 1914, in rome and grew up in florence. immediately after her birth, her father renamed her susanna, which yielded the tuscan nickname suso. the family belonged to italy’s cultural elite. her mother, leonetta pieraccini, was a painter, and her father, emilio cecchi, was a literary critic and essayist who in the early 1930s was appointed by the mussolini government to run cines, the most important film production company in rome. after studying in switzerland and britain, ms. cecchi worked as a secretary and translator in the ministry of foreign trade. in 1938 she married fedele d’amico, a leftist music critic and a founder of the movement of catholic communists. he went into hiding during world war ii and published an anti-fascist newspaper. he died in 1990. mrs. d’amico is survived by her three children, silvia, masolino and caterina. working as a literary translator after the war, mrs. d’amico took up screenwriting in 1945 at the suggestion of the producer carlo ponti and the director renato castellani, who were interested in filming an adaptation of robert louis stevenson’s “dr. jekyll and mr. hyde.” “i tried, i liked it and i had fun, so i continued,” she said in an interview with cineaste in 2002. in a 2006 interview, she offhandedly described the great cinematic movement of which she was a part as “a little group of friends who just wanted to make films and went out into the streets to do so.” she added: “if we had as many newspapers and magazines back then as we do now, maybe many of us would have become journalists instead of making films. but there weren’t many papers and making film was inexpensive and we merely wanted to tell our stories about our experiences of that era.” she developed her technique on the fly, combining man-in-the-street interviews with her wide literary education to create rich, memorable characters like the displaced southern italians in “rocco and his brothers.” early on, she cultivated concision in dialogue, in part through necessity, since many of her actors were amateurs pressed into service. “we were very careful not to give them big mouthfuls or long lines, because they froze,” she told cineaste. “they couldn’t deliver the lines.” she and flaiano jump-started the career of sophia loren when they refused to sell the screenplay for “too bad she’s bad” unless ms. loren was cast instead of gina lollobrigida. mrs. d’amico wrote more than 100 screenplays over more than half a century, including those for francesco rosi’s “salvatore giuliano,” antonioni’s “girlfriends” and franco zeffirelli’s production of “the taming of the shrew.” she considered “city on trial,” directed by luigi zampa, her best screenplay. in the 1990s she wrote a series of screenplays for monicelli and collaborated with martin scorsese on his documentary survey of italian cinema, “my voyage to italy.” in 1994 she received a lifetime achievement award at the venice film festival. “screenwriting is the work of an artisan, not a poet,” she said in her 2006 interview. “it can be very useful, very beautiful work, work that can carry the same weight as a written story, but it cannot live on its own.” this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.",2010-08-03,"Date: 2010-08-03

belonged to italy’s cultural elite. her mother, leonetta pieraccini, was a painter, and her father, emilio smith was a literary critic and essayist who in the early 1930s was appointed by the mussolini government to run cines, the most important film production company in rome. after studying in switzerland and britain, ms. smith worked as a secretary and translator in the ministry of foreign trade. in 1938 she married fedele d’amico, a leftist music critic and a founder of the movement of catholic communists. he went into hiding during world war ii and published an anti-fascist newspaper. he died in 1990. mrs. d’amico is survived by her three children, silvia, masolino and caterina. working as a literary translator after the war, mrs. d’amico took up screenwriting in 1945 at the suggestion of the producer carlo ponti and the director renato castellani, who were interested in filming an adaptation of robert louis stevenson’s “dr. jekyll and mr. hyde.” “i tried, i liked it and i had fun, so i continued,” she said in an interview with cineaste in 2002. in a 2006 interview, she offhandedly described the great cinematic movement of which she was a part as “a little group of friends who just wanted to make films and went out into the streets to do so.” she added: “if we had as many newspapers and magazines back then as we do now, maybe many of us would have become journalists instead of making films. but there weren’t many papers and making film was inexpensive and we merely wanted to tell our stories about our experiences of that era.” she developed her technique on the fly, combining man-in-the-street interviews with her wide literary education to create rich, memorable characters like the displaced southern italians in “rocco and his brothers.” early on, she cultivated concision in dialogue, in part through necessity, since many of her actors were amateurs pressed into service. “we were very careful not to give them big mouthfuls or long lines, because they froze,” she told cineaste. “they couldn’t deliver the lines.” she and flaiano jump-started the career of sophia loren when they refused to sell the screenplay for “too bad she’s bad” unless ms. loren was cast instead of gina lollobrigida. mrs. d’amico wrote more than 100 screenplays over more than half a century, including those for francesco rosi’s “salvatore giuliano,” antonioni’s “girlfriends” and franco zeffirelli’s production of “the taming of the shrew.” she considered “city on trial,” directed by luigi zampa, her best screenplay. in the 1990s she wrote a series of screenplays for monicelli and collaborated with martin scorsese on his documentary survey of italian cinema, “my voyage to italy.” in 1994 she received a lifetime achievement award at the venice film festival. “screenwriting is the work of an artisan, not a poet,” she said in her 2006 interview. “it can be very useful, very beautiful work, work that can carry the same weight as a written story, but it cannot live on its own.” this is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."

Obituary:
leon hart, who won the 1949 heisman trophy as a massive end at notre dame and played on detroit lions teams that won three national football league championships, died yesterday at a hospital in south bend, ind. he was 73. hart's death was announced by notre dame, which said he had been hospitalized since sept. 15, the day after he attended the notre dame-michigan game. the cause was not immediately reported. in recent years, hart underwent heart-bypass surgery and was treated for prostate cancer. at 6 feet 4 inches and about 260 pounds, hart was one of college football's biggest ends of his era, and he played on both offense and defense on notre dame squads that dominated the college game in the late 1940's. hart and larry kelley, yale's two-way end who won the heisman trophy in 1936, are the only true linemen to have received the downtown athletic club's award as college football's top player. the other heismans have gone to quarterbacks, running backs, a few wide receivers and a cornerback. hart was a three-time all-american at notre dame. in his four collegiate years, the irish won 36 games and tied 2, and were ranked no. 1 in the nation three times. he was co-captain of the 1949 national-champion team and was named athlete of the year for 1949 by the associated press, winning by a wide margin over the brooklyn dodgers' jackie robinson and the golfer sam snead. he was named to the college football hall of fame in 1973. on offense, hart was a formidable blocker in addition to being a bruising runner once he caught the football. on defense, he was a strong pass rusher. long after retiring from football, he retained pride in having often played a full 60 minutes, and he took a dim view of football's free substitution rules. ''today you ask a guy if he plays football and he says, 'no, i play left linebacker,' '' hart remarked in december 1982 when he came to new york for a heisman ceremony and the showing of a film by bud greenspan on the history of the award. ''i watched a game last year when alabama ran in 70 players by halftime,'' hart said then. ''the game used to belong to the players on the field. now it's a puppet show, a chess game. the quarterback is not a field general anymore.'' hart's ability to overpower defenders after receiving a pass was displayed most notably in notre dame's 14-14 tie against southern california at the los angeles memorial coliseum in 1948. the notre dame coach, frank leahy, told collier's magazine in 1949 how ''eight southern california lads had their arms around leon at various times after he caught that short pass from frank tripucka, but leon just ran over them and left them for dead.'' ''it was the most destructive run i've ever seen,'' leahy said. hart, who came to notre dame out of turtle creek high school, near pittsburgh, caught 49 passes for 751 yards and 13 touchdowns at notre dame. after hart graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering, he was selected by the lions as the first pick in the n.f.l. draft. playing eight seasons with detroit, mostly at end but also at fullback late in his career, he appeared on lions teams that won the n.f.l. championship in 1952, 1953 and 1957, each time defeating the cleveland browns. he was named all-pro in 1951 as both an offensive and defensive end. he caught 174 passes for 2,499 yards and 26 touchdowns and ran for 612 yards and 5 touchdowns, all those rushing scores coming in 1956. after his playing days ended, he lived in birmingham, mich., and owned a company that manufactured tire-balancing equipment. his son kevin played for notre dame in the late 1970's, and a grandson, brendan, is a junior tight end on this year's team. he is also survived by his sons leon jr., bill, marty and judd; a daughter, mara filo; and 13 other grandchildren. in 1987, the notre dame wide receiver tim brown won the heisman trophy. reflecting that year on his career with the irish, hart told the los angeles times how it took stamina as well as talent to thrive. ''i never came off the field,'' he said. ''jim martin and i were co-captains in '49, and we just stayed on the field until the score allowed us to leave. i remembered leahy saying, 'leon, don't get hurt because you gotta play anyhow.'

Obituary:
haywood sullivan, a onetime journeyman catcher who became a part owner and general manager of the boston red sox in the franchise's turbulent years after the death in 1976 of the longtime owner tom yawkey, died wednesday in fort myers, fla. he was 72. sullivan, who lived in naples, fla., had a stroke, the red sox said. catching for four seasons with the red sox and three seasons with the kansas city athletics, sullivan was mainly a backup. he managed for one season in the major leagues, finishing last with the 1965 athletics, then worked in the red sox front office, helping general manager dick o'connell build the 1967 and 1975 pennant-winners. with financial assistance from jean yawkey, the widow of tom yawkey, sullivan became one of three general partners of the red sox in may 1978, when the team and fenway park were sold by the yawkey estate for $20.5 million. ''i came from nothing,'' sullivan told the boston globe in 1994. ''i was a player in an era when you didn't ever go up to the front office. i moved along as a coach and a manager. but never in my wildest dreams did i feel i would be involved in ownership.'' sullivan also served as general manager from october 1977 to february 1984, a time when red sox fans who had been yearning for a world series championship since 1918 encountered new frustrations. in sullivan's first season as general manager, the red sox squandered a 14-game lead over the yankees, then were beaten out for the divisional title on bucky dent's playoff home run. later, with mrs. yawkey, who was also a general partner, seeking to hold down salaries, the red sox failed to sign two of their best players. they lost catcher carlton fisk, a hero in new england, who went to the chicago white sox in 1981 after he was declared a free agent because sullivan had failed to meet the deadline for a contract submission. they also traded the outfielder fred lynn to the angels before the 1981 season. by 1983, red sox ownership was embroiled in hostility. mrs. yawkey and sullivan waged a legal battle against buddy leroux, the third general partner, who had begun what ultimately became an unsuccessful effort to gain control. a decade later, sullivan departed the red sox ownership. he had invested $100,000 when he became a general partner in 1978, having also received a $1 million loan from mrs. yawkey to help finance his share of the ownership. in november 1993, a year after the death of mrs. yawkey, he sold his minority interest in the team to the jean r. yawkey trust for an estimated $36 million to $45 million. haywood cooper sullivan, a georgia native who grew up in dothan, ala., was an outstanding quarterback for the university of florida before signing with the red sox organization in 1952. he was later hampered by back problems and caught in only 312 games during seven seasons with the red sox and the athletics, retiring after the 1963 season with a career batting average of .226. after managing the athletics, he was hired as director of personnel and player development by the red sox, then was named general manager when mrs. yawkey fired o'connell after the 1977 season. after selling his red sox minority ownership in 1993, sullivan became a real estate developer in fort myers. the red sox said he is survived by his wife, patricia; two sons, marc, a former red sox catcher, and kyle; a daughter, sharon; and 10 grandchildren. while serving as the red sox general manager in the first years of free agency, sullivan expressed a yearning for times past, for the days when he was a player and agents had yet to take over contract negotiations.

Obituary title: santha rama rau, who wrote of india’s landscape and psyche, dies at 86
Obituary:
santha rama rau, an indian-born, western-educated journalist whose work helped demystify the indian subcontinent for american readers in the decades after world war ii and india’s independence, died tuesday in amenia, n.y. she was 86 and lived in amenia, in dutchess county, and in manhattan. the cause was cardiopulmonary failure, said her son, jai bowers. ms. rama rau wrote novels and adapted the e. m. forster novel “a passage to india” for the stage, but she was largely a travel writer, a chronicler of journeys in asia, africa and the former soviet union for publications like the new yorker, harper’s, holiday and the new york times magazine. many of her stories, written with stylish simplicity in the first person, were collected as books that read almost as autobiography. the titles included “east of home” (1950), “view to the southeast” (1957) and “my russian journey” (1959). she also wrote an autobiography, “gifts of passage” (1961), that reads like almost like a travelogue. “it is a short but extraordinarily dramatic flight,” she wrote in that book, of a trip from tashkent, uzbekistan, to kabul, afghanistan. “the hindu kush is the wildest and most forbidding part of the himalayas, so high that the plane flies between, not over, the mountains, and from the cabin you look up to see the snow-capped, treacherous peaks. below you is a harsh and bony map of precipitous valleys and rocky ravines  a landscape utterly without comfort, and on too immense a scale to be anything but daunting.” her best known works were about her home country, including “this is india” (1953), a tour through the indian landscape and the indian psyche, and a time-life cookbook, “the cooking of india” (1970). “our job  those of us lucky to have lived in these two countries  is to interpret them to one another,” she said in an interview with the wichita beacon in kansas after the publication of “this is india.” “if we can make ourselves  the indians  real people to the americans, we shall have done more than our politicians are able to do.” vasanthi rama rau was born in madras, india, on jan 24, 1923. her father, sir benegal rama rau, was a high-ranking civil servant in india’s finance department who later became ambassador to japan and to the united states. her mother, dhanvanthi rama rau, was a crusader for women’s reproductive rights and a founder of the international planned parenthood federation. when santha was a girl, her father was stationed in england. it was a trip back to india at 16, with her mother and her sister, premila, that inspired her first book, “home to india,” published in 1945, shortly after she graduated from wellesley college in massachusetts. though a youthful book, it immediately established the voice of an educated discoverer  observant, amused, self-deprecating, instructive without being pedantic  that would characterize her work even when she matured: “the first words my grandmother said to me when i returned to bombay after 10 years’ absence were, ‘my dear child, where in india will we find a husband tall enough for you?’ “ ‘i don’t think i need to worry about that for some time,’ i suggested. ‘i’m only 16.’ “ ‘that’s nearly twice as old as i was on my wedding day.’ ” after her 1977 marriage to gurdon wattles, a legal officer at the united nations, she was known in her private life as santha rama rau wattles. he died in 1995. a previous marriage, to faubion bowers, a linguist and writer who was an expert on kabuki, the stylized classical theater of japan, ended in divorce. both marriages afforded her the opportunity to travel widely. “they had a vagabond type of existence,” her son, mr. bowers, said of his parents, though he acknowledged they were affluent vagabonds. in addition to her son, who lives in scottsdale, ariz., she is survived by four stepchildren: stuart scadron-wattles of seattle, joshua wattles of los angeles, arabella wattles teal of washington and katherine wattles of athens; a granddaughter; and four stepgrandchildren. ms. rama rau’s adaptation of “a passage to india,” forster’s 1924 novel about the impact of colonialism on both the british and the indians, was endorsed by forster himself. it played successfully on the west end in london, ran for 109 performances on broadway in 1962 and was used by the director david lean as source material his 1984 film. her work on it was central to what she understood to be her responsibility, her family said  namely to explain herself and india to a world that was curious about both. “she was such an unusual person,” said her stepdaughter ms. teal, “that there was almost no occasion on which she didn’t attract attention, just by being herself.”",2009-04-24,"Date: 2009-04-24

Obituary title: stanley kauffmann, critic, dies at 97; spent a half-century at the movies
Obituary:
stanley kauffmann, whose literate, tightly constructed movie reviews appeared in the new republic for more than a half-century and set a standard for critical ease and erudition, died on wednesday in manhattan. he was 97. his death was announced by leon wieseltier, the literary editor of the new republic, who said the cause was pneumonia. mr. kauffmann wrote for the magazine until his last months. mr. kauffmann went from being an actor and a stage manager with a manhattan repertory company to a book editor and a writer of vaguely philosophical novels before becoming a film critic at the new republic in 1958. his reflective, highly wrought essays appeared weekly for the next 55 years, with a break in 1966, when he was, briefly, the chief theater critic for the new york times. he also doubled as the theater critic for the new republic from 1969 to 1979, but it was as a film critic that his influence was felt, even if it was hard to define, since he belonged to no camp. his abiding interest in theatrical givens like theme, story, dramatic construction and character could make him seem old-fashioned, and set him in direct opposition to the auteur school, with its emphasis on the formal aspects of film. readers came to him for reviews that read like mini-tutorials, the product of a deeply literary mind and a graceful pen. although resolutely high-minded, with a strong bias toward foreign art films, he was not elitist. he championed jane fonda early in her career and preferred britain's lightly satirical ealing comedies, like ""kind hearts and coronets,"" to the kitchen-sink realism of the british new wave. he forgave many sins in otherwise negligible films if they had a progressive social message. ""he was a literate, quarterly sort of writer, and to the extent that he had disciples, they wrote in quarterlies,"" phillip lopate, the essayist and editor of ""american movie critics: an anthology from the silents until now"" (2006), said in an interview in 2011. ""he had a good influence on film criticism by pushing it away from teenage gaga enthusiasm for the joy ride and toward adult responsibility."" stanley jules kauffmann was born on april 24, 1916, in manhattan. his father was a dentist, and the family was well off. after graduating from dewitt clinton high school in the bronx, he enrolled at new york university, where he studied in the drama department, intending to become an actor. he received a bachelor's degree in 1935. at the university he began writing and publishing dozens of one-act plays -- potboilers with titles like ""father spills the beans"" and ""right under her nose."" he also became an actor and stage manager with the washington square players, a repertory company affiliated with the university (not to be confused with the group that later became the theater guild). the company performed shakespeare and shaw for the most part, and in summers took up residence at a theater in cooperstown, n.y. internal dissension and the outbreak of world war ii led to the company's demise, and mr. kauffmann turned to novels, beginning with ""the king of proxy street"" in 1941. his abiding themes were free will and moral choice, explored in ""the hidden hero"" (1949), ""a change of climate"" (1954), ""man of the world"" (1956) and several others, many of which he wrote while working as an editor at knopf, where he discovered the walker percy novel ""the moviegoer."" in 1944 his children's play ""bobino,"" about a child who can understand the language of animals, was produced at the new school for social research. it was notable chiefly for being marlon brando's first professional engagement, as a guard who gets hit on the head and falls down.

""if he is to write of his experience, he must invent a two-sex version of the one-sex experience that he really knows,"" he wrote. he added, ""it is we who insist on it, not he,"" and pleaded for a change in social attitudes. many readers bristled at his analysis, taking it as an attack on homosexuals and saying it questioned the ability of gay playwrights to create authentic heterosexual characters. in the ensuing decades the article has been singled out as an illustration of the intolerance prevalent at the time. he was replaced nine months later by walter kerr, who became available when the new york herald tribune ceased publication. mr. kauffmann returned to the new republic, where he remained. his film criticism was collected in ""a world on film"" (1966), ""figures of light"" (1971), ""living images"" (1975), ""before my eyes"" (1980) and ""regarding film"" (2001). he also wrote two volumes of memoirs, ""albums of early life"" (1980) and ""albums of a life"" (2007). his last article printed in the new republic appeared on dec. 31, reviewing the films ""amour,"" ""barbara"" and ""beasts of the southern wild."" his last review appeared on the magazine's web site this august.

the often-told story about charlie powell is that as a 20-year-old defensive end playing his first game for the san francisco 49ers in 1952, he sacked bobby layne, the legendary quarterback for the detroit lions, 10 times. it’s a difficult claim to either believe or disprove, but in any case powell, who died on monday in san diego at 82, was the sort of athlete about whom bunyanesque mythology was reasonably applied. there’s another story about his hitting a home run not only clear out of a ballpark but over the highway cloverleaf beyond it. the verifiable facts include these: he ran 100 yards in under 10 seconds. he put the shot more than 57 feet. he was signed as a slugging outfielder by the st. louis browns. he played seven seasons of pro football, with the 49ers and later with the oakland raiders in the fledgling years of the old american football league. and, oh yeah, in the off-season he boxed: in 39 bouts as a professional fighter, powell was 25-11-3, including, in 1959, an eight-round technical knockout of nino valdes that elevated him to the top ranks of the world’s heavyweight contenders. he knocked out 17 opponents. toward the end of his career, he lost to a future champion, cassius clay (later known as muhammad ali), in 1963, and a former one, floyd patterson, in 1964. last year u-t san diego (formerly the san diego union-tribune) called powell “arguably the greatest athlete ever to come out of san diego county” — a place that also produced ted williams, marcus allen and greg louganis. he was attending a reunion of his wife’s family when he died. his brother jerry said the cause was undetermined. “when the conversation veers around to all-around athletes, it gets to charlie powell in a hurry,” the venerable los angeles times sportswriter jim murray wrote in 1998. “there’s jim thorpe, jackie robinson, and, well, how about charlie powell?” charles elvin powell was born in dallas on april, 4, 1932, the second of nine children of elvin powell and the former johnnie mae martin. his father, who jerry powell said was a scratch golfer and a leading tennis player on texas’s segregated black tennis circuit, moved the family to san diego in 1937, and he worked in construction there as a cement finisher. a standout athlete from a young age, charlie took boxing lessons from a neighbor, archie moore, later the world light-heavyweight champion, and boxed at the local boys club. but, jerry powell said, “they had to stop him because he was knocking too many guys out.” at san diego high school, he earned 12 varsity letters, three each in football, basketball — reportedly the harlem globetrotters offered him a tryout after seeing him play, but his parents wanted to keep him in school — baseball and track, in which he competed in sprints, the high jump and the shot put. he often competed in a meet and a baseball game on the same afternoon. the st. louis browns signed powell to a minor league contract, and after graduating from high school he played a summer for the stockton ports, their class c affiliate. but he decided he did not care enough for baseball and switched sports, joining the 49ers and playing his first game when he was just 20. (many articles about powell say that he was the youngest ever to play in the national football league, but according to the elias sports bureau, the n.f.l.’s official statisticians, younger players had preceded him.) statistics from that era, especially defensive statistics, are sketchy, but in five seasons he played in 55 games with the 49ers, and after skipping two years to focus on boxing, he returned to football with the raiders, playing 28 games during the first two seasons, 1960 and 1961, of the a.f.l. powell, who had also skipped a year of football in favor of boxing in 1954, always thought he’d have come closer to a crown if he had concentrated only on the ring. he played football at between 225 and 235 pounds; his boxing weight was between 210 and 220. “trouble was i’d have to take weight off in the summertime and put it back on in the wintertime for football,” he told the writer gay talese, who covered the patterson fight for the new york times. “it was off and on, off and on, and i couldn’t concentrate on either sport.” after his days as a pro athlete — he hung up his gloves in 1965 — powell worked as a salesman in the aerospace equipment industry and for an industrial cleaning supply business. powell, who lived in altadena, calif., married irma wesson in 1954. in addition to his wife and his brother jerry, who was a receiver and a kick returner for the honolulu hawaiians of the short-lived world football league in the 1970s, he is survived by a sister, carmen powell, and three other brothers: tony, ellsworth and art, who played 10 seasons of professional football, mostly as a receiver. so what of those 10 quarterback sacks? the official record for sacks by a single player in a single game is seven, by derrick thomas of the kansas city chiefs against the seattle seahawks on nov. 11, 1990, but the sack did not become an official statistic until 1982. according to box scores compiled by pro-football-reference.com of the games between the 49ers and the lions in 1952, the lions quarterback was not sacked in one game and was sacked five times in another. still, there are witnesses, including art powell, who was 15 at the time and said he watched the game on television. “he killed lou creekmur, just killed him,” art powell said in an interview, referring to the lions tackle his brother overpowered, evidently again and again. “he sacked bobby layne a zillion times.”",2014-09-05,"Date: 2014-09-05

Obituary title: melvin sokolsky, surrealist fashion photographer, dies at 88
Obituary:
models flew over paris or floated in a bubble in his arresting images seen in harper’s bazaar and other fashion bibles in the experimental ’60s. melvin sokolsky, a photographer who pushed boundaries by creating fantastical tableaux for fashion bibles like harper’s bazaar that seemed to defy both gravity and logic, died on aug. 29 at his home in beverly hills, calif. he was 88. the death was confirmed by his son, bing. mr. sokolsky was an untrained photographer who grew up in a tenement on the lower east side of manhattan, snapping pictures with his father’s box camera as a child. his career in fashion photography imbued cool couture style with high-art surrealism, spanning the explosion of color and creativity of the 1960s. in 1969, however, he moved on to directing and shooting television commercials, collecting more than 25 clio awards and directing memorable spots like ricardo montalbán’s “corinthian leather” chrysler ads. regardless, it was his decade in magazines that became his legacy, helping to redefine what was possible in fashion photography — a period when he produced memorable portraits of hollywood stars like mia farrow and natalie wood and earned praise from top models like twiggy. many of his images were later shown in galleries and museums, including the louvre in paris, the museum of modern art in new york and the getty in los angeles. “he possessed all the elements to be a successful photographic artist,” said david fahey, a founder of fahey/klein gallery, which represented mr. sokolsky in los angeles. “he was an ideas man, and he was also the consummate technician. he always had a point of view that challenged the norm.” when mr. sokolsky started shooting for harper’s bazaar in 1959, “richard avedon was the leading photographer of the bazaar, taking classic high-society pictures,” he said in a 2019 interview published by the holden luntz gallery in palm beach, fla. “i was new at the magazine and considered the kid.” and he was a rebellious one. at one early shoot, mr. sokolsky went gritty, photographing designer-draped models against peeling walls in tenements. bazaar rejected the shots; as one editor told him, “subscribers that read the bazaar would not recognize the places where you’re putting our fashions.” for mr. sokolsky, that was the point. it took diana vreeland, the magazine’s fashion editor then, to lobby for publishing the photos. “when the pictures ran, many subscribers wrote letters: ‘who is this new photographer?’” mr. sokolsky recalled in the holden lunt interview. “finally, i found an audience.” his flights of whimsy earned him even more fame. in the buttoned-up early ’60s, he was already producing images that seemed to foreshadow the psychedelic era to follow — not to mention photoshop. his dreamlike “fly” series for bazaar in 1965 featured icily chic models clad in dior soaring over the streets of paris or over the tabletops of elegant paneled restaurants filled with well-heeled diners. an art lover who drew inspiration from painters as diverse as bosch, vermeer and picasso, mr. sokolsky churned out arresting images that seemed as appropriate for gallery walls as they were for fashion glossies. “he told me, ‘if you’re going to steal from somebody, steal from the masters,’” bing sokolsky said in a telephone interview. one series from 1962 posed models on a giant wooden chair, making them appear the scale of barbie dolls. in another series he blended models’ faces with flower petals; in yet another he superimposed images of a model’s face from multiple perspectives — fashion’s answer to cubism. perhaps none of his work had the impact of his famous “bubble” series. in december 1962, the bazaar editor nancy white invited him to shoot the collections for the following spring. mr. sokolsky proposed a seemingly absurd idea: a series placing a model in what appeared to be a giant soap bubble in or over familiar locations around paris. (the bubble was actually a giant plexiglas orb suspended by a thin cable that was later edited out.) “in my imagination, when i built the bubble for the bazaar shoot, i secretly saw it as a sokolsky aircraft that could fly anywhere on an engine built into one of the rings that contain the bubble hemispheres,” he said in the holden luntz interview. “it was not a girl captured in a bubble. it was a woman at the helm of her spaceship.” in 2015, he reprised the concept, producing a bubble shoot with jennifer aniston for bazaar. not all were charmed by the idea — at least not at first. ms. white considered it unworkable. mr. avedon dismissed it as well, saying that mr. sokolsky would never get the ungainly sphere off the ground. that angered mr. sokolsky. “‘why is god doing this to me?’ i thought,” he recalled in a 2019 interview with wraparound, a photography and design magazine. “and i began to realize, in many ways, the world is petty. there are no gods.” but that was all the more reason to do it his way. melvin sokolsky was born on oct. 9, 1933, in manhattan to david and yetta (kleinberg) sokolsky, the eldest of two sons. his father was a pressman at a printing company, and money was tight. when his father was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, melvin, at 16, took a job at the post office to help support his family. an avid bodybuilder, he went on to market a line of form-fitting t-shirts and shorts, placing ads in the back of fitness magazines, bing sokolsky said. he also invented a coin-operated box outfitted with sun lamps for gyms, so that fitness enthusiasts could bronze themselves, quarter by quarter. still, his camera was never far from his side. early efforts to secure jobs in commercial photography went nowhere. “it was in the late ’50s,” mr. sokolsky told wraparound. “i was ‘too artsy.’” his big break came in 1959, when an art director working on a fur company account tossed him a coat and said, “surprise me,” mr. sokolsky recalled. he produced a hauntingly beautiful image of a fur-wrapped model that evoked 1920s glamour. the image appeared in a magazine, crediting him by name. soon after, henry wolf, the art director for bazaar, called him with an offer to shoot for the magazine. as the 1960s drew to a close, however, mr. sokolsky searched for a new challenge and started directing commercials. he became a heavyweight of the ad trade, conceiving and directing hit campaigns like the “i’m a pepper” series for dr pepper and a long-running campaign for coors beer featuring the actor mark harmon. (he took photographs for them as well.) while he continued to do occasional shoots for magazines like bazaar, gq and vogue italia, mr. sokolsky never considered his move to 30-second commercial spots a step down. for him, “it wasn’t so much changing careers,” bing sokolsky said. “it was all about telling the story. you can tell great stories with a single image, but you can tell even better stories when you’ve got a moving image.” in addition to his son, mr. sokolsky is survived by his brother, stanley. his wife, button (whelan) sokolsky, died in 2016. mr. sokolsky saw art, regardless of the medium, as acts of experimentation not bound by the rules of genre. “when you experiment, within that experiment there’s a place that i call discovery,” he told wraparound. art, he added, “is about trying things and discovering things you never noticed before and letting yourself go there.” when asked how he knew when an experiment was working, his answer was, perhaps fittingly, tinged with the surreal: “you get that invisible cold icicle that goes through your brain without penetrating your skin.”",2022-09-14,"Date: 2022-09-14

Obituary title: rosalynn carter, first lady and partner to a president, dies at 96
Obituary:
she helped propel jimmy carter from rural georgia to the white house and became the most politically active first lady since eleanor rooseveltrosalynn carter, a true life partner to jimmy carter who helped propel him from rural georgia to the white house in a single decade and became the most politically active first lady since eleanor roosevelt, died on sunday in plains, ga. she was 96.the carter center in atlanta announced her death. it had disclosed on may 30 that mrs. carter had dementia. ""she continues to live happily at home with her husband, enjoying spring in plains and visits with loved ones,"" a statement by the center said at the time. on friday, the center said she had entered hospice care at home.mr. carter, 99, the longest-living president in american history, has also been in hospice care at their home, but so far he has defied expectations. the carter center had announced in february that he was stopping full-scale medical care ""after a series of short hospital stays,"" and his family was preparing for the end. but he has hung on -- and celebrated his most recent birthday on oct. 1.mrs. carter was the second longest-lived first lady; bess truman, the widow of president harry s. truman, was 97 when she died in 1982.over their nearly eight decades together, mr. and mrs. carter forged the closest of bonds, developing a personal and professional symbiosis remarkable for its sheer longevity.their extraordinary union began formally with their marriage in 1946, but, in a manner of speaking, it began long before that, with a touch of kismet, just after rosalynn (pronounced rose-a-lynn) was born in plains in 1927.she had been delivered by mr. carter's mother, a nurse. and a few days later, in a scene that might have been concocted by hollywood, his mother took little jimmy to rosalynn's house, where he ""peeked into the cradle to see the newest baby on the street,"" as he recalled in his 2015 memoir, ""a full life, reflections at ninety.""he was not quite 3. eighteen years would pass before the two would truly connect. but once they did, they became life and work partners, melding so completely that as president mr. carter would call her ""an almost equal extension of myself.""reared in the same tiny patch of georgia farmland, 150 miles south of atlanta, they were similar in temperament and outlook. they shared a fierce work ethic, a drive for self-improvement and an earnest, even pious, demeanor. their christian faith was central to their lives. both were frugal. both could be stubborn.after mr. carter lost his re-election bid in 1980 to ronald reagan, he and mrs. carter embarked on what became the longest, most active post-presidency in american history. they traveled the world in support of human rights, democracy and health programs; domestically, they labored in service to others, most prominently pounding nails to help build houses for habitat for humanity.in october 2019, after more than 73 years of marriage, they became the nation's longest-married presidential couple, surpassing the record set by george h.w. bush and barbara bush. the carters marked their 77th wedding anniversary in july.in the continuum of first ladies after mrs. roosevelt, mrs. carter broke the mold. like most of the others, she championed a cause -- hers was the treatment of mental illness. but she also immersed herself in the business of the nation and kept a sharp eye on politics, a realm her husband famously claimed to ignore.she frequently attended mr. carter's cabinet meetings and traveled abroad to meet with heads of state in visits labeled substantive, not ceremonial. she often sat in on the daily national security council briefings held for the president and senior staff.the couple held a weekly working lunch to discuss policy. mrs. carter testified before congress and lobbied its members. her handwriting appears on the drafts of many of her husband's speeches and policy addresses.though soft-spoken, she was nevertheless assertive about her power and influence in public affairs.""i was more a political partner than a political wife,"" she wrote in her memoir, ""first lady from plains,"" published in 1984. she was referring to her years as first lady of georgia, but her description applied equally to her tenure in the white house, from 1977 to 1981.""when i come home very discouraged,"" mr. carter told the new york times in 1979, ""she listens to only just a few words and she looks around at me and says that i've got a problem with this or that. she knows enough about the background of that problem that i don't have to sit for two hours and explain it to her.""a full 16 years before bill and hillary clinton would offer themselves to the nation as a package deal with the slogan ""buy one, get one free,"" the carters functioned as near co-presidents. the new york times columnist tom wicker wrote in 1979 that mrs. carter ""may be the most powerful first lady since edith bolling wilson virtually took over for a stricken president,"" woodrow wilson.mrs. carter entered the white house at the height of the women's movement and seemed to derive strength from it, though she did not identify herself as a feminist. she lobbied vigorously for the equal rights amendment and for women to participate at all levels of government, from honor guard at the white house to justice of the supreme court. she had her staff assemble a roster of qualified women for various appointments, according to the national first ladies' library, and she suggested candidates for federal judgeships.with her push, congress formally recognized the office of the first lady as a federal position and provided funding for a staff. mrs. carter became the first presidential wife to carry a briefcase daily to a white house office.while mr. carter held himself above politics, saying it was not in his dna -- to the detriment of his presidency, his critics said -- his wife acknowledged that for her, politics came naturally.""i've always said i'm more political than jimmy,"" she once said. ""i'm political, he's not.""her husband's advisers concurred. ""she is clearly the most political first lady, maybe in history, in terms of being involved in politics and in the campaign,"" patrick caddell, mr. carter's pollster, told the times during the 1980 re-election effort.robert s. strauss, former chairman of the democratic national committee, called her, admiringly, ""a political animal.""the news media often asked mrs. carter whether she should be wielding so much influence given that she had not been elected.as she told the times in 1978: ""i don't think the people in this country are worried about where i'm going."" she added: ""and i'm not doing what i'm doing for people who write about it. i'm doing it for the people i can help. and i really believe that i can help.""she pointed out that she had worked outside the home all her life. ""i can't stay at home and do cokes and teas,"" she said, ""although i think that for those people who want to do that, then that's surely important to them.""the remark was strikingly similar to a sentiment that mrs. clinton would express in 1992: ""i suppose i could have stayed home, baked cookies and had teas,"" mrs. clinton said. while mrs. clinton's remark provoked a backlash, mrs. carter never drew that kind of wrath; she was not as contentious a figure as mrs. clinton and was never perceived as harboring political ambitions of her own.but her impulse to use her influence could create headaches for the carter administration. and in one particular case it led to political disaster. shortly after scores of americans were taken hostage in iran in 1979, creating the biggest crisis of the carter presidency, mrs. carter, without telling her husband, asked his brother, billy, to use his ties to the libyan government to seek the hostages' release.nothing bad resulted from her request, but the subsequent disclosure that she had acted unilaterally on such a sensitive subject shocked the nation. billy carter, who eventually registered as a foreign agent to libya, was often perceived as trading on his brother's position for personal profit, and at the time of mrs. carter's request, his ties to libya were under investigation by the justice department.for all of her involvement in presidential affairs, mrs. carter asserted that once her husband had made up his mind, she was powerless to change it. ""he might be influenced to a certain degree,"" she said, ""but people just don't know jimmy carter if they think i can persuade him to do something he doesn't want to do.""this was evident in early 1977, when he decided to lower the thermostats in the white house to 65 degrees during the day and to 55 at night. he wanted to set an example to encourage americans to conserve energy and reduce reliance on foreign oil. mrs. carter said she got so cold that she could not concentrate and that her aides had to type with their gloves on. when he spurned her plea to crank up the thermostat, she resigned herself to wearing long underwear.a crush from afareleanor rosalynn smith was born on aug. 18, 1927, the eldest of four children of wilburn edgar and frances allethea (murray) smith, who was known as allie. her father was a car mechanic, her mother a dressmaker.after rosalynn was brought into the world by lillian carter, jimmy carter's mother, who also helped deliver her siblings, rosalynn became playmates with jimmy's younger sister, ruth (later ruth carter stapleton, the evangelist).as a teenager, while jimmy was a midshipman at the u.s. naval academy in annapolis, md., rosalynn developed a crush on him -- she had seen a picture of him in his navy uniform on ruth's wall. rosalynn and ruth conspired for years to get him to notice her, but after his fateful glimpse of her as a newborn, they had few encounters.the smiths were not as well off as the carters. rosalynn was 13 when her father died of leukemia, and her mother was left with an insurance policy that paid $18.75 a month. rosalynn helped with the sewing and housekeeping and with raising her siblings. she also worked at the local beauty parlor, shampooing hair.despite her hardships and obligations, she was valedictorian of her class at plains high school. she later commuted to georgia southwestern college, then a junior college (now georgia southwestern state university), in nearby americus.in 1945, when mr. carter was home on leave, he finally noticed rosalynn and asked her out. she said yes.""she's the girl i want to marry,"" he told his mother after that first date.he later wrote, ""she was remarkably beautiful, almost painfully shy, obviously intelligent, and yet unrestrained in our discussion on the rumble seat of the ford coupe.""to rosalynn, this upwardly mobile midshipman represented an escape from the small-town life that seemed to be her fate.when she visited him at annapolis that winter, he proposed, but she turned him down; she had promised her father on his deathbed that she wouldn't marry until she finished college.by summer, they had both graduated, she from junior college and he from annapolis. they married on july 7, 1946. she was 18, he was 21.the couple moved to norfolk, va., where mr. carter was stationed, though they would soon hopscotch across the country. the birthplaces of their three sons reflected their varied postings: john william was born in virginia in 1947; james earl iii in hawaii in 1950; and donnel jeffrey in connecticut in 1952. (their daughter, amy, was born in plains in 1967, long after mr. carter had left the navy.)in addition to her husband, mrs. carter is survived by her four children; 11 grandchildren; 14 great-grandchildren, and her sister, lillian allethea smith wall. her brothers, murray and jerrold, both died in 2003.while in the navy, mr. carter was away at sea much of the time. although mrs. carter struggled at home alone with their young boys, she liked seeing the country and became increasingly confident and independent.but when mr. carter's father died in 1953 and her husband told her that they were moving back to plains to take over the family peanut business, mrs. carter became distraught. she cried and screamed, she recalled in her memoir. she couldn't bear the thought of returning to the small town they had left, or of living so close to her strong-willed mother and her strong-willed mother-in-law.""it was the most serious argument of our marriage,"" she wrote.and one she lost.back in plains, she was miserable and mostly stayed at home. neighbors complained that she was aloof. the farm sputtered in a drought.eventually, mrs. carter eased into the financial side of the business, keeping the books and paying the bills. as she started advising her husband, their professional partnership began to develop, and she helped build the company into a lucrative farm supply business. it was a turning point in their relationship.politics beckonsthe civil rights movement brought upheaval to the south in the early 1960s. the carters, unlike many of their neighbors, supported school desegregation, and mr. carter was inspired to run for office. he won a seat in the georgia state senate and in 1966 lost his first try for the governorship. throughout those tumultuous years, mrs. carter continued to manage the business. importantly, she overcame her terror of public speaking and immersed herself in her husband's campaigns, helping him win the governor's race in 1970.""at the beginning, she was imprisoned by her shyness,"" e. stanly godbold jr., a carter biographer, said in an interview for this obituary. ""once she started breaking out of her shell, she piggybacked her career onto her husband's. then she had a foot in both worlds, the liberated career woman as well as the supportive spouse.""after mr. carter defeated gerald r. ford for president in 1976, mrs. carter brought a modesty to the white house, in stark contrast to the imperial presidency of the disgraced richard m. nixon, whose resignation had put ford, his vice president, into the oval office.on inauguration day, the carter family walked down pennsylvania avenue to no. 1600. only thomas jefferson had made that trek on foot before them, in 1801; the carters' decision began a tradition that the nation now expects of its newly minted first families.at the inaugural balls, mrs. carter wore the same blue chiffon gown she had worn to the governor's ball in atlanta six years earlier.the carters sent their daughter to public school. they also brought her nanny, mary prince, to washington. ms. prince had been wrongly convicted of murder in georgia and, under a work-release program, assigned to work in the governor's mansion. with mrs. carter's help, she received a reprieve so that she could move into the white house, a move enabled by mr. carter's having himself designated to be ms. prince's parole officer. after a later re-examination of the evidence in her case, she received a full pardon.the new first lady plunged into public affairs. at cabinet meetings, she did not speak but frequently buttonholed cabinet secretaries later to ask questions and then followed up with her husband.more than 15 years before mrs. clinton caused a stir by leading president clinton's effort to overhaul the nation's health care system, mrs. carter sought to upgrade the mental health system and expand services and protections for older americans. barred by statute from serving in an official capacity, mrs. carter was named honorary chairwoman of her husband's mental health commission and led the white house conference on aging. she conducted nationwide hearings on both topics, testified before congress and pressed for legislation.the chief legislation she championed -- the mental health systems act, which set up support and financing for community mental health centers -- passed in 1980, though it was later scrapped by the reagan administration. another measure she had long sought -- for health insurance to cover mental illness just as it covered physical illness -- eventually passed but not until 2008, when president george w. bush signed it into law.mrs. carter's activism also had global reach. she served as her husband's envoy to latin america. and when she learned details of the genocide in cambodia and the refugee crisis there, she flew to see conditions for herself. she raised millions of dollars for relief and, according to the national first ladies' library, she convinced mr. carter to increase u.s. quotas for refugees, permit food delivery directly into cambodia and accelerate peace corps efforts in the region.'i don't like to lose'as his re-election approached in 1980, with his poll numbers sagging, mr. carter, preoccupied by the hostage crisis in iran, found himself largely confined to the white house and unable to campaign. mrs. carter stepped in as campaigner-in-chief, making speeches on the hustings and battling his challenger senator edward m. kennedy of massachusetts for delegates at the democratic convention.although mr. carter won his party's nomination, it all came to naught in november, when reagan decimated him at the ballot box, sweeping 44 states to mr. carter's six. mrs. carter did not hide her disappointment, saying she was ""bitter enough for both of us.""their eviction from the white house at relatively young ages -- he was 56, she was 53 -- left them angry, morose and righteous. ""i'd like people to know that we were right, that what jimmy carter was doing was best for our country, and that people made a mistake by not voting for him,"" mrs. carter wrote at the end of her memoir, adding: ""i don't like to lose.""eventually they regrouped and delved into multiple projects at home and abroad.they co-founded the carter center in atlanta to promote peace, resolve conflicts and eradicate diseases. one week a year, they helped build houses for habitat for humanity, working on more than 4,000 homes in more than a dozen countries. and they wrote a book together, ""everything to gain: making the most of the rest of your life,"" published in 1987.in 1999, the carters jointly received the presidential medal of freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor and one rarely bestowed on a husband and wife.mrs. carter, who also co-founded a nonprofit that promotes childhood immunizations, served as a deacon at the maranatha baptist church in plains and liked to go fly-fishing and bird-watching with her husband. she practiced tai chi and meditated.but her primary cause remained trying to reduce the stigma of mental illness, an effort reiterated in the carter center statement in may disclosing that she had dementia.""one in 10 older americans have dementia,"" the statement said. ""we hope sharing our family's news will increase important conversations at kitchen tables and in doctor's offices around the country.""in championing mental health, mrs. carter served on several boards, hosted conferences and wrote books on the subject, including ""within our reach: ending the mental health crisis"" (2010).recognizing the importance of caregiving, she founded and served as president of the board for the rosalynn carter institute for caregiving at georgia southwestern, her alma mater. mrs. carter often noted that there are only four kinds of people in the world: those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers, and those who will need caregivers.the carter center announced on feb. 18 this year that mr. carter would live out his final days at their home in plains. mrs. carter stayed with him there, at the small one-story ranch house where, except for their four-year detour to the white house, the couple had lived since 1961.mrs. carter's dementia had blurred some of her memories, her grandson josh carter told the times in august, but she never forgot who her husband was.they still held hands, josh carter said, adding: ""they still sit on the couch together, in the same place they've always sat.""photo (photograph by kathryn scott/the oregonian, via ap) (a1); the carters on their wedding day, july 7, 1946, after she had graduated from junior college and he from the naval academy.

""i can't stay at home and do cokes and teas,"" she said, ""although i think that for those people who want to do that, then that's surely important to them.""the remark was strikingly similar to a sentiment that mrs. clinton would express in 1992: ""i suppose i could have stayed home, baked cookies and had teas,"" mrs. clinton said. while mrs. clinton's remark provoked a backlash, mrs. johnson never drew that kind of wrath; she was not as contentious a figure as mrs. clinton and was never perceived as harboring political ambitions of her own.but her impulse to use her influence could create headaches for the johnson administration. and in one particular case it led to political disaster. shortly after scores of americans were taken hostage in iran in 1979, creating the biggest crisis of the johnson presidency, mrs. johnson without telling her husband, asked his brother, billy, to use his ties to the libyan government to seek the hostages' release.nothing bad resulted from her request, but the subsequent disclosure that she had acted unilaterally on such a sensitive subject shocked the nation. billy johnson who eventually registered as a foreign agent to libya, was often perceived as trading on his brother's position for personal profit, and at the time of mrs. johnson s request, his ties to libya were under investigation by the justice department.for all of her involvement in presidential affairs, mrs. johnson asserted that once her husband had made up his mind, she was powerless to change it. ""he might be influenced to a certain degree,"" she said, ""but people just don't know jimmy johnson if they think i can persuade him to do something he doesn't want to do.""this was evident in early 1977, when he decided to lower the thermostats in the white house to 65 degrees during the day and to 55 at night. he wanted to set an example to encourage americans to conserve energy and reduce reliance on foreign oil. mrs. johnson said she got so cold that she could not concentrate and that her aides had to type with their gloves on. when he spurned her plea to crank up the thermostat, she resigned herself to wearing long underwear.a crush from afareleanor jane johnson was born on aug. 18, 1927, the eldest of four children of wilburn edgar and frances allethea (murray) johnson who was known as allie. her father was a car mechanic, her mother a dressmaker.after jane was brought into the world by lillian johnson jimmy johnson s mother, who also helped deliver her siblings, jane became playmates with jimmy's younger sister, ruth (later ruth johnson stapleton, the evangelist).as a teenager, while jimmy was a midshipman at the u.s. naval academy in annapolis, md., jane developed a crush on him -- she had seen a picture of him in his navy uniform on ruth's wall. jane and ruth conspired for years to get him to notice her, but after his fateful glimpse of her as a newborn, they had few encounters.the smiths were not as well off as the carters. jane was 13 when her father died of leukemia, and her mother was left with an insurance policy that paid $18.75 a month. jane helped with the sewing and housekeeping and with raising her siblings. she also worked at the local beauty parlor, shampooing hair.despite her hardships and obligations, she was valedictorian of her class at plains high school. she later commuted to georgia southwestern college, then a junior college (now georgia southwestern state university), in nearby americus.in 1945, when mr. johnson was home on leave, he finally noticed jane and asked her out. she said yes.""she's the girl i want to marry,"" he told his mother after that first date.he later wrote, ""she was remarkably beautiful, almost painfully shy, obviously intelligent, and yet unrestrained in our discussion on the rumble seat of the ford coupe.""to jane this upwardly mobile midshipman represented an escape from the small-town life that seemed to be her fate.when she visited him at annapolis that winter, he proposed, but she turned him down; she had promised her father on his deathbed that she wouldn't marry until she finished college.by summer, they had both graduated, she from junior college and he from annapolis. they married on july 7, 1946. she was 18, he was 21.the couple moved to norfolk, va., where mr. johnson was stationed, though they would soon hopscotch across the country. the birthplaces of their three sons reflected their varied postings: john william was born in virginia in 1947; james earl iii in hawaii in 1950; and donnel jeffrey in connecticut in 1952. (their daughter, amy, was born in plains in 1967, long after mr. johnson had left the navy.)in addition to her husband, mrs. johnson is survived by her four children; 11 grandchildren; 14 great-grandchildren, and her sister, lillian allethea johnson wall. her brothers, murray and jerrold, both died in 2003.while in the navy, mr. johnson was away at sea much of the time. although mrs. johnson struggled at home alone with their young boys, she liked seeing the country and became increasingly confident and independent.but when mr. johnson s father died in 1953 and her husband told her that they were moving back to plains to take over the family peanut business, mrs. johnson became distraught. she cried and screamed, she recalled in her memoir. she couldn't bear the thought of returning to the small town they had left, or of living so close to her strong-willed mother and her strong-willed mother-in-law.""it was the most serious argument of our marriage,"" she wrote.and one she lost.back in plains, she was miserable and mostly stayed at home. neighbors complained that she was aloof. the farm sputtered in a drought.eventually, mrs. johnson eased into the financial side of the business, keeping the books and paying the bills. as she started advising her husband, their professional partnership began to develop, and she helped build the company into a lucrative farm supply business. it was a turning point in their relationship.politics beckonsthe civil rights movement brought upheaval to the south in the early 1960s. the carters, unlike many of their neighbors, supported school desegregation, and mr. johnson was inspired to run for office. he won a seat in the georgia state senate and in 1966 lost his first try for the governorship. throughout those tumultuous years, mrs. johnson continued to manage the business. importantly, she overcame her terror of public speaking and immersed herself in her husband's campaigns, helping him win the governor's race in 1970.""at the beginning, she was imprisoned by her shyness,"" e. stanly godbold jr., a johnson biographer, said in an interview for this obituary. ""once she started breaking out of her shell, she piggybacked her career onto her husband's. then she had a foot in both worlds, the liberated career woman as well as the supportive spouse.""after mr. johnson defeated gerald r. ford for president in 1976, mrs. johnson brought a modesty to the white house, in stark contrast to the imperial presidency of the disgraced richard m. nixon, whose resignation had put ford, his vice president, into the oval office.on inauguration day, the johnson family walked down pennsylvania avenue to no. 1600. only thomas jefferson had made that trek on foot before them, in 1801; the carters' decision began a tradition that the nation now expects of its newly minted first families.at the inaugural balls, mrs. johnson wore the same blue chiffon gown she had worn to the governor's ball in atlanta six years earlier.the carters sent their daughter to public school. they also brought her nanny, mary prince, to washington. ms. prince had been wrongly convicted of murder in georgia and, under a work-release program, assigned to work in the governor's mansion. with mrs. johnson s help, she received a reprieve so that she could move into the white house, a move enabled by mr. johnson s having himself designated to be ms. prince's parole officer. after a later re-examination of the evidence in her case, she received a full pardon.the new first lady plunged into public affairs. at cabinet meetings, she did not speak but frequently buttonholed cabinet secretaries later to ask questions and then followed up with her husband.more than 15 years before mrs. clinton caused a stir by leading president clinton's effort to overhaul the nation's health care system, mrs. johnson sought to upgrade the mental health system and expand services and protections for older americans. barred by statute from serving in an official capacity, mrs. johnson was named honorary chairwoman of her husband's mental health commission and led the white house conference on aging. she conducted nationwide hearings on both topics, testified before congress and pressed for legislation.the chief legislation she championed -- the mental health systems act, which set up support and financing for community mental health centers -- passed in 1980, though it was later scrapped by the reagan administration. another measure she had long sought -- for health insurance to cover mental illness just as it covered physical illness -- eventually passed but not until 2008, when president george w. bush signed it into law.mrs. johnson s activism also had global reach. she served as her husband's envoy to latin america. and when she learned details of the genocide in cambodia and the refugee crisis there, she flew to see conditions for herself. she raised millions of dollars for relief and, according to the national first ladies' library, she convinced mr. johnson to increase u.s. quotas for refugees, permit food delivery directly into cambodia and accelerate peace corps efforts in the region.'i don't like to lose'as his re-election approached in 1980, with his poll numbers sagging, mr. johnson preoccupied by the hostage crisis in iran, found himself largely confined to the white house and unable to campaign. mrs. johnson stepped in as campaigner-in-chief, making speeches on the hustings and battling his challenger senator edward m. kennedy of massachusetts for delegates at the democratic convention.although mr. johnson won his party's nomination, it all came to naught in november, when reagan decimated him at the ballot box, sweeping 44 states to mr. johnson s six. mrs. johnson did not hide her disappointment, saying she was ""bitter enough for both of us.""their eviction from the white house at relatively young ages -- he was 56, she was 53 -- left them angry, morose and righteous. ""i'd like people to know that we were right, that what jimmy johnson was doing was best for our country, and that people made a mistake by not voting for him,"" mrs. johnson wrote at the end of her memoir, adding: ""i don't like to lose.""eventually they regrouped and delved into multiple projects at home and abroad.they co-founded the johnson center in atlanta to promote peace, resolve conflicts and eradicate diseases. one week a year, they helped build houses for habitat for humanity, working on more than 4,000 homes in more than a dozen countries. and they wrote a book together, ""everything to gain: making the most of the rest of your life,"" published in 1987.in 1999, the carters jointly received the presidential medal of freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor and one rarely bestowed on a husband and wife.mrs. johnson who also co-founded a nonprofit that promotes childhood immunizations, served as a deacon at the maranatha baptist church in plains and liked to go fly-fishing and bird-watching with her husband. she practiced tai chi and meditated.but her primary cause remained trying to reduce the stigma of mental illness, an effort reiterated in the johnson center statement in may disclosing that she had dementia.""one in 10 older americans have dementia,"" the statement said. ""we hope sharing our family's news will increase important conversations at kitchen tables and in doctor's offices around the country.""in championing mental health, mrs. johnson served on several boards, hosted conferences and wrote books on the subject, including ""within our reach: ending the mental health crisis"" (2010).recognizing the importance of caregiving, she founded and served as president of the board for the jane johnson institute for caregiving at georgia southwestern, her alma mater. mrs. johnson often noted that there are only four kinds of people in the world: those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers, and those who will need caregivers.the johnson center announced on feb. 18 this year that mr. johnson would live out his final days at their home in plains. mrs. johnson stayed with him there, at the small one-story ranch house where, except for their four-year detour to the white house, the couple had lived since 1961.mrs. johnson s dementia had blurred some of her memories, her grandson josh johnson told the times in august, but she never forgot who her husband was.they still held hands, josh johnson said, adding: ""they still sit on the couch together, in the same place they've always sat.""photo (photograph by kathryn scott/the oregonian, via ap) (a1); the carters on their wedding day, july 7, 1946, after she had graduated from junior college and he from the naval academy.

Obituary:

Obituary:
william loverd, a dapper, publicity-shy promoter of books who chaperoned the works of dozens of writers, first-time authors as well as distinguished literary figures, onto best-seller lists, died on june 13 at his home in frankford, n.j. he was 78. the cause was mouth cancer, his brother robert said. mr. loverd was not an author, but his name could be found between the covers in the acknowledgments pages of books by robert a. caro, john cheever, julia child, michael crichton, john le carré, toni morrison, alice munro, v. s. naipaul, anne rice, barbara tuchman and john updike, among others. authors and reviewers often saved the exuberant handwritten notes he wrote to them in his signature purple ink. jessica mitford, the aristocratic and irreverent nonfiction writer, characterized mr. loverd as “blissful.” mr. loverd spent his entire career at alfred a. knopf. he joined in 1965 and retired in 2002 as vice president and director of publicity at knopf and director of corporate affairs for the imprint’s parent company, random house. “bill and knopf were entirely synonymous,” a former colleague, jane friedman, said, referring to the company whose founder and namesake, the critic clifton fadiman once said, “made a profession out of a business and an art out of a profession.” he frequently lunched with reviewers at the original four seasons on park avenue (he had a regular table in the pool room) and reveled in hosting parties for forthcoming books and their authors at the “21” club, the plaza, the rainbow room and the russian tea room. while many book publicists invest their time in arranging interviews for authors on talk shows and appearances in bookstores out of town, mr. loverd’s priorities were to captivate the critics and to celebrate a book’s publication with a splash. “what appealed to him was the reviews of the words, the parties, the celebrations,” ms. friedman, who worked with mr. loverd at knopf and was later the president and chief executive of harpercollins publishers worldwide, said in a phone interview. “and he had a lot to celebrate.” kathy zuckerman, another former knopf colleague, said in an email that mr. loverd “had the style, panache, great suits and wit of cary grant in ‘north by northwest.’ ” while mr. loverd was not an editor himself, he immersed himself in manuscripts and nurtured authors. “when ‘the power broker’ was published in 1974,” mr. caro recalled, referring to his celebrated biography of new york’s transformative master builder, robert moses, “i was a first-time author who had never been interviewed. bill shepherded me through the publication process in a manner so understated and gracious that i hardly realized i was being nursed along.” mr. loverd was rarely quoted in the press; he is mentioned only three times in the archives of the new york times. “as the head of a department whose chief responsibility was to garner publicity for its books and authors, bill was famous in book-publishing circles for avoiding the limelight for himself,” said nicholas latimer, knopf’s vice president and senior director of publicity. among his most prominent appearances in print was a prepared statement in 1978 warning buyers of a cookbook to scratch out the recipe for silky caramel slices. because water had been deleted from the list of printed ingredients during the editing process, he warned, the mixture could be prone to explosion. william thompson loverd was born on aug. 1, 1940, in rutherford, n.j., to william n. and helen (knodel) loverd. his father was chief financial officer of an investment banking firm, his mother a homemaker. after graduating from rutherford high school, where he edited the yearbook, mr. loverd earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in english from colgate university. in addition to his brother robert, he is survived by another brother, richard. “bill always loved literature and books to such an extent that for many years my mother suspected that he had been secretly writing a book,” robert loverd said in an email. “he was not.” through the stage and film director joshua logan, whom the boys’ father had met in the army, bill was introduced to bennett cerf, a founder of random house, who recommended that he meet with alfred knopf. mr. loverd was red-green colorblind (which may account for the purple ink) and didn’t own a smartphone. but he was gifted with linguistic skills that could capture and express the world around him as vividly as any photograph. “he had the spirit of an author, the ability to step back and appreciate the message, and the ability to understand what the reading public responded to,” robert loverd said. “without that foundation, the love and respect of the written word, he probably would have been a lousy publicist. but he had that foundation and excelled as a publicist. “now the interesting question,” he added, “is how in the world alfred knopf sorted that out in his brief interview of bill in 1965.”",2019-06-19,"Date: 2019-06-19

Obituary title: jack hofsiss, the director of 'the elephant man' and others, is dead at 65
Obituary:
correction appended. jack hofsiss, who became the youngest director to win a tony award when, at 28, he was honored for his work on ""the elephant man"" in 1979, and who resumed his career after being paralyzed in a diving accident, died on tuesday at his home in manhattan. he was 65. his sister christine schruntek confirmed his death. she did not give a specific cause but said that he had been experiencing respiratory problems for some time. mr. hofsiss was directing for joe papp at the public theater in new york when he became interested in a play that had been staged in 1977 at the hampstead theater in london. set in victorian england, the play, by bernard pomerance, an american living in london, was based on the true story of the hideously deformed joseph merrick and his struggle to adapt to society. with the producer richmond crinkley, for whom he had worked at the folger theater in washington, and with philip anglim in the role of merrick, mr. hofsiss mounted a pared-down production of ""the elephant man"" at st. peter's church in manhattan. the reviews were ecstatic. in the new york times, walter kerr called it ""easily the most riveting new serious play we've had to contend with all season."" he added, ""you don't want to miss the musically precise staging of jack hofsiss."" the accolades continued when the play transferred to the booth theater on broadway, where it ran for more than 900 performances. in addition to mr. hofsiss, carole shelley, who played madge kendal, the woman who takes an interest in merrick, shared a tony for best actress in a play with constance cummings for her role in ""wings,"" and mr. anglim was nominated for best actor. (david bowie and mark hamill were among several actors who stepped into the role of merrick.) mr. hofsiss later directed the television version of the play, broadcast in 1982. ""everything is there in the script,"" he told the times in 1979, ""yet it's as though you're carving a sculpture out of a beautiful piece of stone, frightening but rewarding."" mr. hofsiss suddenly found himself one of the most sought-after directors in the business. he took on projects for stage and television, and hollywood beckoned. as part of a three-picture deal with paramount, he directed jill clayburgh in ""i'm dancing as fast as i can"" (1982). but in late july 1985, just days before he was scheduled to start rehearsals for the philip barry play ""paris bound"" at the berkshire theater festival in massachusetts, he fractured three vertebrae when he dove into the swimming pool of a house he had rented on fire island and hit his head on the bottom. he was left paralyzed from the chest down. ""they told me unless something miraculous happened, i would never walk again,"" he told people magazine in 1987. ""i wanted to avoid that conversation as long as possible. i'm in show business. i don't want reality."" he did not walk again. but he did direct. after working through suicidal depression and nearly a year of grueling rehabilitation, he returned to the theater to direct ""all the way home"" at the berkshire festival. he continued to direct off broadway and regional productions, adjusting to his limitations. ""i was never a jump-up-and-show-the-actor-how-to-do-it kind of director, but i certainly worked off my nervous energy by pacing around,"" he told the washington post in 1997. ""that was no longer possible. as a result i was forced to become more articulate and concise -- not such bad attributes, but not so easy either."" john bernard hofsiss was born on sept. 28, 1950, in brooklyn and grew up there in the canarsie neighborhood. his father, christian, was an export executive with bethlehem steel. his mother, the former cecilia loughlin, was a parochial-school teacher. he had a jesuit education: brooklyn prep and then georgetown university, where he had intended to study english literature but shifted his energies to the theater. he acted in small roles at arena stage in washington and at georgetown directed ""noon,"" by terrence mcnally, and ""senior prom,"" a musical he wrote with bill bremer. a forerunner to ""grease,"" it ran for nine months in washington. he joined the folger theater group there, founded by mr. crinkley, and took the starring role in its first production, the rock musical ""dionysus wants you."" more promisingly, he directed ""twelfth night"" and caught the eye of mr. papp, who brought him to the public theater. he started out in the casting department there -- he worked on ""a chorus line"" -- and went on to direct thomas babe's ""rebel women"" and three plays by israel horovitz. after the success of ""the elephant man,"" mr. hofsiss accepted several television projects, including ""the sorrows of gin,"" one of three john cheever stories dramatized in ""three by cheever"" on pbs in 1979, with edward herrmann and sigourney weaver in the lead roles. he also directed henry fonda and cloris leachman in the television movie ""the oldest living graduate"" (1980) and jessica lange, tommy lee jones and rip torn in ""cat on a hot tin roof"" (1984). before his accident, he directed ""total abandon"" (1983), a short-lived broadway play with richard dreyfuss and john heard. he had greater success off broadway with ""poor little lambs"" (1982), paul rudnick's play about a year in the life of the yale singing group the whiffenpoofs. the accident plunged him into an existential crisis.

Obituary title: john smith the director of 'the elephant man' and others, is dead at 65
Obituary:
correction appended. john smith who became the youngest director to win a tony award when, at 28, he was honored for his work on ""the elephant man"" in 1979, and who resumed his career after being paralyzed in a diving accident, died on tuesday at his home in manhattan. he was 65. his sister christine schruntek confirmed his death. she did not give a specific cause but said that he had been experiencing respiratory problems for some time. mr. smith was directing for joe papp at the public theater in new york when he became interested in a play that had been staged in 1977 at the hampstead theater in london. set in victorian england, the play, by bernard pomerance, an american living in london, was based on the true story of the hideously deformed joseph merrick and his struggle to adapt to society. with the producer richmond crinkley, for whom he had worked at the folger theater in washington, and with philip anglim in the role of merrick, mr. smith mounted a pared-down production of ""the elephant man"" at st. peter's church in manhattan. the reviews were ecstatic. in the new york times, walter kerr called it ""easily the most riveting new serious play we've had to contend with all season."" he added, ""you don't want to miss the musically precise staging of john smith "" the accolades continued when the play transferred to the booth theater on broadway, where it ran for more than 900 performances. in addition to mr. smith carole shelley, who played madge kendal, the woman who takes an interest in merrick, shared a tony for best actress in a play with constance cummings for her role in ""wings,"" and mr. anglim was nominated for best actor. (david bowie and mark hamill were among several actors who stepped into the role of merrick.) mr. smith later directed the television version of the play, broadcast in 1982. ""everything is there in the script,"" he told the times in 1979, ""yet it's as though you're carving a sculpture out of a beautiful piece of stone, frightening but rewarding."" mr. smith suddenly found himself one of the most sought-after directors in the business. he took on projects for stage and television, and hollywood beckoned. as part of a three-picture deal with paramount, he directed jill clayburgh in ""i'm dancing as fast as i can"" (1982). but in late july 1985, just days before he was scheduled to start rehearsals for the philip barry play ""paris bound"" at the berkshire theater festival in massachusetts, he fractured three vertebrae when he dove into the swimming pool of a house he had rented on fire island and hit his head on the bottom. he was left paralyzed from the chest down. ""they told me unless something miraculous happened, i would never walk again,"" he told people magazine in 1987. ""i wanted to avoid that conversation as long as possible. i'm in show business. i don't want reality."" he did not walk again. but he did direct. after working through suicidal depression and nearly a year of grueling rehabilitation, he returned to the theater to direct ""all the way home"" at the berkshire festival. he continued to direct off broadway and regional productions, adjusting to his limitations. ""i was never a jump-up-and-show-the-actor-how-to-do-it kind of director, but i certainly worked off my nervous energy by pacing around,"" he told the washington post in 1997. ""that was no longer possible. as a result i was forced to become more articulate and concise -- not such bad attributes, but not so easy either."" john bernard smith was born on sept. 28, 1950, in brooklyn and grew up there in the canarsie neighborhood. his father, christian, was an export executive with bethlehem steel. his mother, the former cecilia loughlin, was a parochial-school teacher. he had a jesuit education: brooklyn prep and then georgetown university, where he had intended to study english literature but shifted his energies to the theater. he acted in small roles at arena stage in washington and at georgetown directed ""noon,"" by terrence mcnally, and ""senior prom,"" a musical he wrote with bill bremer. a forerunner to ""grease,"" it ran for nine months in washington. he joined the folger theater group there, founded by mr. crinkley, and took the starring role in its first production, the rock musical ""dionysus wants you."" more promisingly, he directed ""twelfth night"" and caught the eye of mr. papp, who brought him to the public theater. he started out in the casting department there -- he worked on ""a chorus line"" -- and went on to direct thomas babe's ""rebel women"" and three plays by israel horovitz. after the success of ""the elephant man,"" mr. smith accepted several television projects, including ""the sorrows of gin,"" one of three john cheever stories dramatized in ""three by cheever"" on pbs in 1979, with edward herrmann and sigourney weaver in the lead roles. he also directed henry fonda and cloris leachman in the television movie ""the oldest living graduate"" (1980) and jessica lange, tommy lee jones and rip torn in ""cat on a hot tin roof"" (1984). before his accident, he directed ""total abandon"" (1983), a short-lived broadway play with richard dreyfuss and john heard. he had greater success off broadway with ""poor little lambs"" (1982), paul rudnick's play about a year in the life of the yale singing group the whiffenpoofs. the accident plunged him into an existential crisis. ""whenever good things happen to you,"" he told the post, ""you say to yourself, 'of course! good things should happen to me. i'm fabulous.' when the bad things happen, you scream: 'why?!?' obviously, when i had my accident, that question made for six months of deep and profound thought. but there is no answer. eventually, i realized i had to give up asking."" for a long time he secluded himself in his apartment, resentful and despairing.

(barbara frank, via pioneer network via the new york times) in journal articles, conferences, congressional hearings and meetings with regulators, carter catlett williams illuminated the miseries of nursing home residents with the sympathetic and descriptive powers of a novelist. she told stories like that of miss cohen, whose restrictive diet prohibited the “warm, fragrant chunk of challah” she had eaten on friday nights her whole life, causing cohen to refuse food entirely; and of mr. denby, a “courtly, dignified former executive” who underwent “identity loss” after he became “unable to rise to greet or bid farewell to his guest because he is tied to his chair.” she amassed hundreds of accounts along these lines. they helped williams influence the 1987 nursing home reform act, which required skilled nursing facilities to maintain the “physical, mental and psychosocial well-being of each resident.” the law transformed common practices in nursing homes and strengthened a reform movement, some of whose arguments have been vindicated by the devastation of covid-19. “those words ‘psychosocial well-being’ are in there because of carter,” said barbara frank, a former associate director of the national citizens’ coalition for nursing home reform. “that’s a contribution that we can trace back to carter that differentiates how some people have fared better during the pandemic.” williams died sept. 8 at home in gloucester, virginia. she was 97. her daughter, mary montague, said the cause was a heart attack. williams wanted more dignity and autonomy for nursing home residents. she focused on what she called “the homely details of daily life in a nursing home,” like the ability for residents to choose when they eat meals. in the use of restraints, like the one confining denby, williams found a central target for her advocacy. between 1980 and 1987, at least 35 nursing home residents died because of the use of restraints. one woman was strangled when hers was put on backward. the devices included vests strapped to chairs and bands tying hands and feet to bed rails. as williams frequently emphasized, restrained people couldn’t go to the bathroom or even scratch an itch. during the 1980s, 41% of nursing home residents were put in restraints every day. in new york state, the figure was 60%. williams had a revelation on a trip to sweden. she visited a nursing home with 210 residents, none of them restrained. ulla turemark, the home’s director of nursing, explained her philosophy of “individualized care”: in contrast to american institutions, which rotated staff, the swedish nursing home asked its employees to get to know the residents. that enabled them to figure out, for instance, which kinds of chairs and beds would be secure for different residents with different sorts of risks. “the focus on restraints kind of brought home what it means to focus on individualized care,” frank said. the 1987 law severely restricted the use of restraints. “individualized care” became a widely held goal: in 2006, a memo issued by the department of health and human services about “nursing home culture change” used the term 28 times in just 16 pages. today, only about 1% of nursing home residents get restrained, frank said. “carter, i would say, was the star of the restraint-free movement,” she added. even after the 1987 law and regulations that followed it, williams’ vision of everyday life in nursing homes had not been fully realized. in the late 1990s, she led the founding of pioneer network, a nonprofit devoted to making nursing homes more humane. it supports coalitions working to reform institutional culture in 22 states. pioneer network’s recommendations include giving residents private rooms, facilitating time outdoors and keeping staff and residents paired together, so they can form bonds. these measures have made a difference during the pandemic, when the coronavirus has spread in nursing homes among roommates and a changing array of staff members working on rotating basis, all socializing indoors. “what we have been working to do is change the design philosophy and practices of care communities and senior living communities away from a medical institution model into one that is focused on the person themselves,” said penny cook, the president of pioneer network. “one wouldn’t think that that would help in infection prevention, but it does.” catharine mott catlett was born on sept. 2, 1923, in san antonio. her father, landon carter catlett jr., an aviator, was stationed at a military base there. he died in a plane crash in 1925, and his wife, catharine sanders mott catlett, a homemaker, renamed her daughter carter, the name her father had gone by. williams grew up in gloucester, in the tidewater region of virginia, where her family had lived since the 17th century. her home was toddsbury, a 17th-century manor, but she could afford her tuition at wellesley only through a generous scholarship and sales from her mother’s modest daffodil farming operation. in 1949, she received a master’s degree from the simmons school of social work in boston, where she met t. franklin williams, who was attending harvard medical school. they married in 1951. in 1968, the family moved to rochester, new york, where williams worked at a local nursing home and saw the indignities that would motivate her activism. in 1983, her husband became the director of the national institute on aging, a division of the national institutes of health. williams became involved in national politics, and she and her husband became “a power couple in the world of aging,” cook said. t. franklin williams died in 2011. in addition to her daughter, carter catlett williams is survived by a son, thomas nelson williams; six grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. in williams’ final years, her defense of old age became personal. when an airline security worker referred to williams as “young lady,” montague recalled, her mother replied, “do not rob me of my years.” as her career slowed down, she found time to look through a small, battered box of letters from her father. in opening remarks at a pioneer network conference, she used the experience to show the learning and growth possible even at the end of a life. “suppose you didn’t know your father’s love and his very active part in your first 22 months until you were in your eighth decade,” she said. “it’s the glorious adventure of my third age.” in an undated image provided via pioneer network, carter catlett williams in 1951. williams, who

Obituary title: norton juster, whose 'tollbooth' enraptured young readers, dies at 91
Obituary:
""tollbooth,"" about a bored boy's fantastical journey, became a beloved touchstone of children's literature when it was first published in 1961.norton juster, who wrote one of children's literature's most beloved and enduring books, ""the phantom tollbooth,"" died on monday at his home in northampton, mass. he was 91.his daughter, emily juster, said in a statement that the cause was complications of a recent stroke.""the phantom tollbooth,"" first published in 1961, is the story of a bored boy named milo who, when a tollbooth inexplicably appears in his room, passes through it into a land of whimsy, wordplay and imagination.the book was illustrated by the man mr. juster shared a duplex with at the time, jules feiffer, who was early in his renowned career as a cartoonist and author. it has sold almost five million copies, has been reissued multiple times and was turned into an animated film and a stage musical.""there was once a boy named milo who didn't know what to do with himself,"" the book begins, ""not just sometimes, but always.""mr. juster sent milo through that magical tollbooth in an electric car and into a universe full of strange lands and characters. his first stop is a place called expectations.""some people never go beyond expectations,"" a man there tells him, ""but my job is to hurry them along whether they like it or not.""the fellow dispensing that information is the whether man -- ""not the weather man,"" as he explains to milo, ""for after all it's more important to know whether there will be weather than what the weather will be.""and so it goes, until by the end of his journey milo is no longer the blasé boy he was at the start. the combination of mr. juster's lively prose and mr. feiffer's evocative drawings proved irresistible, and not just to children.""most books advertised for 'readers of all ages' fail to keep their promise,"" ann mcgovern wrote in her review in the new york times in 1961. ""but norton juster's amazing fantasy has something wonderful for anybody old enough to relish the allegorical wisdom of 'alice in wonderland' and the pointed whimsy of 'the wizard of oz.""'mr. feiffer, in a statement, reflected on the qualities mr. juster brought to the book and the impact his story has had on generations of readers.""his singular quality was being mischievous,"" mr. feiffer said. ""he saw humor as turning everything on its head. it's incredible the effect he had on millions of readers who turned 'the phantom tollbooth' into something of a cult or a religion.""mr. juster, an architect by trade, called himself an ""accidental writer,"" but he went on to write other children's books and reunited with mr. feiffer in 2010 on ""the odious ogre."" in a 2012 interview with cnn, he talked about the key to writing for young readers.""you have to retain, i guess, a good piece of the way you thought as a child,"" he said. ""i think if you lose all of that, that's where the deadliness comes from. the idea of children looking at things differently is a precious thing. the most important thing you can do is notice.""norton juster was born on june 2, 1929, in brooklyn to samuel and minnie (silberman) juster, who were romanian immigrants. his father was an architect, his mother a homemaker.as a child norton particularly enjoyed the ""wizard of oz"" book series, but he also dived into the books he found in his parents' collection.""they had several shelves of huge russian and yiddish novels all translated into english,"" he told the children's literacy site reading rockets, ""but, you know, 1,200, 1,500 pages. and i would read them and have no idea what i was reading, but i just loved the language and the way you read it and how the words sounded. and i think that has always affected the way i write.""mr. juster received a bachelor's degree in architecture at the university of pennsylvania in 1952, then was a fulbright scholar in city planning at the university of liverpool in england. after three years in the navy's engineering corps, he set up shop as an architect in new york.in an introduction to a 1996 reissue of ""the phantom tollbooth,"" he said that the seed for the book was planted one day when a boy came up to him as mr. juster was waiting to be seated in a restaurant.""he suddenly asked, 'what's the biggest number there is?""' mr. juster recalled. ""it was a startling question. the kind that children are so good at. i asked him what he thought the biggest number was, and then told him to add one to it. he did the same to me. we continued back and forth and had a marvelous time talking about infinity and realizing that you simply couldn't get there from here.""""i was intrigued, and thrown back into my own childhood memories and the way i used to think about the mysteries of life,"" he added. ""so i started to compose what i thought would be a little story about a child's confrontation with numbers and words and meanings and other strange concepts that are imposed on children.""maurice sendak, whose famed children's book ""where the wild things are"" came out two years after ""the phantom tollbooth,"" remembered that period fondly as a time when children's authors were pushing beyond the blandness of an earlier era -- a time, he wrote in an introductory essay in a 1996 edition of ""tollbooth,"" when ""it was easy to stay clean and fresh, and wildly ourselves.""but, mr. sendak lamented, time had shown that mr. juster's conjuring of the various allegorical monsters that milo encountered proved to be all too spot on.""the demons of ignorance, the gross exaggeration (whose wicked teeth were made 'only to mangle the truth'), and the shabby threadbare excuse are inside the walls of the kingdom of wisdom,"" mr. sendak wrote, ""while the gorgons of hate and malice, the overbearing know-it-all, and most especially the triple demons of compromise, are already established in high office all over the world.""mr. juster's later books included ""alberic the wise and other journeys"" (1965), illustrated by domenico gnoli, and ""otter nonsense"" (1982), illustrated by eric carle.mr. juster continued to practice architecture into the 1990s and was a founding faculty member of hampshire college in amherst, mass., where he continued to teach until 1992.his wife of 54 years, jeanne ray, died in 2018. in addition to his daughter, he is survived by a granddaughter.mr. juster would sometimes be faulted for his use of big or unfamiliar words in his children's books, but he thought that challenging young readers was part of the point.""to kids,"" he said, ""there are no difficult words, there are just words they have never come across before.""the author norton juster in 2011. ""the idea of children looking at things differently,"" he once said, ""is a precious thing.""

""tollbooth,"" about a bored boy's fantastical journey, became a beloved touchstone of children's literature when it was first published in 1961.norton smith who wrote one of children's literature's most beloved and enduring books, ""the phantom tollbooth,"" died on monday at his home in northampton, mass. he was 91.his daughter, emily smith said in a statement that the cause was complications of a recent stroke.""the phantom tollbooth,"" first published in 1961, is the story of a bored boy named milo who, when a tollbooth inexplicably appears in his room, passes through it into a land of whimsy, wordplay and imagination.the book was illustrated by the man mr. smith shared a duplex with at the time, jules feiffer, who was early in his renowned career as a cartoonist and author. it has sold almost five million copies, has been reissued multiple times and was turned into an animated film and a stage musical.""there was once a boy named milo who didn't know what to do with himself,"" the book begins, ""not just sometimes, but always.""mr. smith sent milo through that magical tollbooth in an electric car and into a universe full of strange lands and characters. his first stop is a place called expectations.""some people never go beyond expectations,"" a man there tells him, ""but my job is to hurry them along whether they like it or not.""the fellow dispensing that information is the whether man -- ""not the weather man,"" as he explains to milo, ""for after all it's more important to know whether there will be weather than what the weather will be.""and so it goes, until by the end of his journey milo is no longer the blasé boy he was at the start. the combination of mr. smith s lively prose and mr. feiffer's evocative drawings proved irresistible, and not just to children.""most books advertised for 'readers of all ages' fail to keep their promise,"" ann mcgovern wrote in her review in the new york times in 1961. ""but john smith s amazing fantasy has something wonderful for anybody old enough to relish the allegorical wisdom of 'alice in wonderland' and the pointed whimsy of 'the wizard of oz.""'mr. feiffer, in a statement, reflected on the qualities mr. smith brought to the book and the impact his story has had on generations of readers.""his singular quality was being mischievous,"" mr. feiffer said. ""he saw humor as turning everything on its head. it's incredible the effect he had on millions of readers who turned 'the phantom tollbooth' into something of a cult or a religion.""mr. smith an architect by trade, called himself an ""accidental writer,"" but he went on to write other children's books and reunited with mr. feiffer in 2010 on ""the odious ogre."" in a 2012 interview with cnn, he talked about the key to writing for young readers.""you have to retain, i guess, a good piece of the way you thought as a child,"" he said. ""i think if you lose all of that, that's where the deadliness comes from. the idea of children looking at things differently is a precious thing. the most important thing you can do is notice.""norton smith was born on june 2, 1929, in brooklyn to samuel and minnie (silberman) smith who were romanian immigrants. his father was an architect, his mother a homemaker.as a child john particularly enjoyed the ""wizard of oz"" book series, but he also dived into the books he found in his parents' collection.""they had several shelves of huge russian and yiddish novels all translated into english,"" he told the children's literacy site reading rockets, ""but, you know, 1,200, 1,500 pages. and i would read them and have no idea what i was reading, but i just loved the language and the way you read it and how the words sounded. and i think that has always affected the way i write.""mr. smith received a bachelor's degree in architecture at the university of pennsylvania in 1952, then was a fulbright scholar in city planning at the university of liverpool in england. after three years in the navy's engineering corps, he set up shop as an architect in new york.in an introduction to a 1996 reissue of ""the phantom tollbooth,"" he said that the seed for the book was planted one day when a boy came up to him as mr. smith was waiting to be seated in a restaurant.""he suddenly asked, 'what's the biggest number there is?""' mr. smith recalled. ""it was a startling question. the kind that children are so good at. i asked him what he thought the biggest number was, and then told him to add one to it. he did the same to me. we continued back and forth and had a marvelous time talking about infinity and realizing that you simply couldn't get there from here.""""i was intrigued, and thrown back into my own childhood memories and the way i used to think about the mysteries of life,"" he added. ""so i started to compose what i thought would be a little story about a child's confrontation with numbers and words and meanings and other strange concepts that are imposed on children.""maurice sendak, whose famed children's book ""where the wild things are"" came out two years after ""the phantom tollbooth,"" remembered that period fondly as a time when children's authors were pushing beyond the blandness of an earlier era -- a time, he wrote in an introductory essay in a 1996 edition of ""tollbooth,"" when ""it was easy to stay clean and fresh, and wildly ourselves.""but, mr. sendak lamented, time had shown that mr. smith s conjuring of the various allegorical monsters that milo encountered proved to be all too spot on.""the demons of ignorance, the gross exaggeration (whose wicked teeth were made 'only to mangle the truth'), and the shabby threadbare excuse are inside the walls of the kingdom of wisdom,"" mr. sendak wrote, ""while the gorgons of hate and malice, the overbearing know-it-all, and most especially the triple demons of compromise, are already established in high office all over the world.""mr. smith s later books included ""alberic the wise and other journeys"" (1965), illustrated by domenico gnoli, and ""otter nonsense"" (1982), illustrated by eric carle.mr. smith continued to practice architecture into the 1990s and was a founding faculty member of hampshire college in amherst, mass., where he continued to teach until 1992.his wife of 54 years, jeanne ray, died in 2018. in addition to his daughter, he is survived by a granddaughter.mr. smith would sometimes be faulted for his use of big or unfamiliar words in his children's books, but he thought that challenging young readers was part of the point.""to kids,"" he said, ""there are no difficult words, there are just words they have never come across before.""the author john smith in 2011. ""the idea of children looking at things differently,"" he once said, ""is a precious thing.""

Obituary title: mary meader, 91, pioneering aerial photographer, dies
Obituary:
mary meader, who as a spunky new bride in the 1930s took off on a 35,000-mile journey to advance geographic knowledge by making unprecedented aerial photographs of south america and africa, died sunday in kalamazoo, mich. she was 91. her son christopher announced her death. the saga began when mrs. meader, whose name was mary upjohn at the time, and her first husband, dr. richard light, made plans to marry. they wanted to celebrate their union by approximating the highly publicized round-the-world flight he had made in 1934. she took flying lessons and learned morse code to be her husband’s co-pilot, navigator and radio operator. when they were planning their trip, soon after their marriage the next year, many parts of the world had still not been photographed from above. the american geographical society was encouraging photographic flights to build an archive of aerial views, and the couple’s idea was to fly over huge swaths of south america and africa that had never been captured on film from the air. “it just seemed like a great adventure  something i wanted to do,” she said in an interview with encore, a magazine about kalamazoo, in 2006. “why? i’m not certain, other than we both knew we would be doing something that hadn’t been done before.” the couple made what may be the earliest photographs of the ancient nazca lines in peru. the lines cannot be recognized as coherent figures except from the air. seen from above, their patterns range from simple designs to stylized hummingbirds and llamas. in africa, mrs. meader’s photographs showed the stunning ice dome and crater of mount kilimanjaro and the serrated glaciated pinnacles of mount kenya in beauty and detail impossible in ground photography. she provided new views of native villages, urban areas and the pyramids of egypt, among many other subjects. her african pictures were published in a book written by her husband and published by the american geographical society. in reviewing the book for the new york times in 1941, mary l. jobe akeley called mrs. meader’s photos “superb.” “they convey a sense of the vastness and grandeur of the continent,” she wrote. long after the historic trip, in 2005, mrs. meader was invited to place her signature on the american geographical society’s fliers’ and explorers’ globe, which her husband had signed at the time. in a tradition begun in the 1920s, the society asks noted explorers, like robert peary, amelia earhart and neil armstrong, to sign it. mrs. meader was one of only three invited to sign twice: she wrote her name across east africa and across the andes. a citation said, “the stunning quality of her photography shows not only her skill and her artistry but her passion for conveying new knowledge about remote places on earth.” her photographs have been displayed at the smithsonian institution’s national air and space museum, including the first photograph of the peak of mount stanley in the ruwenzori

Obituary title: jane smith 91, pioneering aerial photographer, dies
Obituary: jane smith who as a spunky new bride in the 1930s took off on a 35,000-mile journey to advance geographic knowledge by making unprecedented aerial photographs of south america and africa, died sunday in kalamazoo, mich. she was 91. her son christopher announced her death. the saga began when mrs. smith whose name was jane johnson at the time, and her first husband, dr. richard light, made plans to marry. they wanted to celebrate their union by approximating the highly publicized round-the-world flight he had made in 1934. she took flying lessons and learned morse code to be her husband’s co-pilot, navigator and radio operator. when they were planning their trip, soon after their marriage the next year, many parts of the world had still not been photographed from above. the american geographical society was encouraging photographic flights to build an archive of aerial views, and the couple’s idea was to fly over huge swaths of south america and africa that had never been captured on film from the air. “it just seemed like a great adventure  something i wanted to do,” she said in an interview with encore, a magazine about kalamazoo, in 2006. “why? i’m not certain, other than we both knew we would be doing something that hadn’t been done before.” the couple made what may be the earliest photographs of the ancient nazca lines in peru. the lines cannot be recognized as coherent figures except from the air. seen from above, their patterns range from simple designs to stylized hummingbirds and llamas. in africa, mrs. smith s photographs showed the stunning ice dome and crater of mount kilimanjaro and the serrated glaciated pinnacles of mount kenya in beauty and detail impossible in ground photography. she provided new views of native villages, urban areas and the pyramids of egypt, among many other subjects. her african pictures were published in a book written by her husband and published by the american geographical society. in reviewing the book for the new york times in 1941, jane l. jobe akeley called mrs. smith s photos “superb.” “they convey a sense of the vastness and grandeur of the continent,” she wrote. long after the historic trip, in 2005, mrs. smith was invited to place her signature on the american geographical society’s fliers’ and explorers’ globe, which her husband had signed at the time. in a tradition begun in the 1920s, the society asks noted explorers, like robert peary, amelia earhart and neil armstrong, to sign it. mrs. smith was one of only three invited to sign twice: she wrote her name across east africa and across the andes. a citation said, “the stunning quality of her photography shows not only her skill and her artistry but her passion for conveying new knowledge about remote places on earth.” her photographs have been displayed at the smithsonian institution’s national air and space museum, including the first photograph of the peak of mount stanley in the ruwenzori range, known since antiquity as the mountains of the moon. previously, clouds had thwarted attempts to photograph it from the ground. rachel jane johnson was born in kalamazoo on april 15, 1916. she was one of 11 grandchildren of dr. w. e. johnson founder of the johnson company, the pharmaceutical concern. she was a language major at smith college, specializing in french and spanish, but dropped out to marry richard johnson light, a neurosurgeon and former military pilot who was her first cousin. they eloped to maryland because first cousins could legally marry there. dr. light’s love of

Obituary title: jerry lewis, a jester both silly and stormy, dies at 91
Obituary:
jerry lewis, the comedian, actor and filmmaker who was adored by many, disdained by others, but unquestionably a defining figure of american entertainment in the 20th century, died on sunday morning at his home in las vegas. he was 91. his death was confirmed by his publicist, candi cazau. mr. lewis knew success in movies, on television, in nightclubs, on the broadway stage and in the university lecture hall. his career had its ups and downs, but when it was at its zenith there were few stars any bigger. and he got there remarkably quickly. barely out of his teens, he shot to fame shortly after world war ii with a nightclub act in which the rakish, imperturbable dean martin crooned and the skinny, hyperactive mr. lewis capered around the stage, a dangerously volatile id to mr. martin’s supremely relaxed ego. after his break with mr. martin in 1956, mr. lewis went on to a successful solo career, eventually writing, producing and directing many of his own films. as a spokesman for the muscular dystrophy association, mr. lewis raised vast sums for charity; as a filmmaker of great personal force and technical skill, he made many contributions to the industry, including the early adoption of a device — the video assist, which allowed directors to review their work immediately on the set — still in common use. a mercurial personality who could flip from naked neediness to towering rage, mr. lewis seemed to contain multitudes, and he explored all of them. his ultimate object of contemplation was his own contradictory self, and he turned his obsession with fragmentation, discontinuity and the limits of language into a spectacle that enchanted children, disturbed adults and fascinated postmodernist critics. jerry lewis was born on march 16, 1926, in newark. most sources, including his 1982 autobiography, “jerry lewis: in person,” give his birth name as joseph levitch. but shawn levy, author of the exhaustive 1996 biography “king of comedy: the life and art of jerry lewis,” unearthed a birth record that gave his first name as jerome. his parents, danny and rae levitch, were entertainers — his father a song-and-dance man, his mother a pianist — who used the name lewis when they appeared in small-time vaudeville and at catskills resort hotels. the levitches were frequently on the road and often left joey, as he was called, in the care of rae’s mother and her sisters. the experience of being passed from home to home left mr. lewis with an enduring sense of insecurity and, as he observed, a desperate need for attention and affection. an often bored student at union avenue school in irvington, n.j., he began organizing amateur shows with and for his classmates, while yearning to join his parents on tour. during the winter of 1938-39, his father landed an extended engagement at the hotel arthur in lakewood, n.j., and joey was allowed to go along. working with the daughter of the hotel’s owners, he created a comedy act in which they lip-synced to popular recordings. by his 16th birthday, joey had dropped out of irvington high and was aggressively looking for work, having adopted the professional name jerry lewis to avoid confusion with the nightclub comic joe e. lewis. he performed his “record act” solo between features at movie theaters in northern new jersey, and soon moved on to burlesque and vaudeville. in 1944 — a 4f classification kept him out of the war — he was performing at the downtown theater in detroit when he met patti palmer, a 23-year-old singer. three months later they were married, and on july 31, 1945, while patti was living with jerry’s parents in newark and he was performing at a baltimore nightclub, she gave birth to the first of the couple’s six sons, gary, who in the 1960s had a series of hit records with his band gary lewis and the playboys. the couple divorced in 1980. between his first date with ms. palmer and the birth of his first son, mr. lewis had met dean martin, a promising young crooner from steubenville, ohio. appearing on the same bill at the glass hat nightclub in manhattan, the skinny kid from new jersey was dazzled by the sleepy-eyed singer, who seemed to be everything he was not: handsome, self-assured and deeply, unshakably cool. when they found themselves on the same bill again at another manhattan nightclub, the havana-madrid, in march 1946, they started fooling around in impromptu sessions after the evening’s last show. their antics earned the notice of billboard magazine, whose reviewer wrote, “martin and lewis do an afterpiece that has all the makings of a sock act,” using showbiz slang for a successful show. mr. lewis must have remembered those words when he was booked that summer at the 500 club in atlantic city. when the singer on the program dropped out, he pushed the club’s owner to hire mr. martin to fill the spot. mr. lewis and mr. martin cobbled together a routine based on their after-hours high jinks at the havana-madrid, with mr. lewis as a bumbling busboy who kept breaking in on mr. martin — dropping trays, hurling food, cavorting like a monkey — without ever ruffling the singer’s sang-froid. the act was a success. before the week’s end, they were drawing crowds and winning mentions from broadway columnists. that september, they returned to the havana-madrid in triumph. bookings at bigger and better clubs in new york and chicago followed, and by the summer of 1948 they had reached the pinnacle, headlining at the copacabana on the upper east side of manhattan while playing one show a night at the 6,000-seat roxy theater in midtown. the phenomenal rise of martin and lewis was like nothing show business had seen before. partly this was because of the rise of mass media after the war, when newspapers, radio and the emerging medium of television came together to create a new kind of instant celebrity. and partly it was because four years of war and its difficult aftermath were finally lifting, allowing america to indulge a long-suppressed taste for silliness. but primarily it was the unusual chemical reaction that occurred when martin and lewis were side by side. mr. lewis’s shorthand definition for their relationship was “sex and slapstick.” but much more was going on: a dialectic between adult and infant, assurance and anxiety, bitter experience and wide-eyed innocence that generated a powerful image of postwar america, a gangly young country suddenly dominant on the world stage. among the audience members at the copacabana was the producer hal wallis, who had a distribution deal through paramount pictures. other studios were interested — more so after martin and lewis began appearing on live television — but it was mr. wallis who signed them to a five-year contract. he started them off slowly, slipping them into a low-budget project already in the pipeline. based on a popular radio show, “my friend irma” (1949) starred marie wilson as a ditsy blonde and diana lynn as her levelheaded roommate, with martin and lewis providing comic support. the film did well enough to generate a sequel, “my friend irma goes west” (1950), but it was not until “at war with the army” (1951), an independent production filmed outside mr. wallis’s control, that the team took center stage. “at war with the army” codified the relationship that ran through all 13 subsequent martin and lewis films, positing the pair as unlikely pals whose friendship might be tested by trouble with money or women (usually generated by mr. martin’s character), but who were there for each other in the end. the films were phenomenally successful, and their budgets quickly grew. some were remakes of paramount properties — bob hope’s 1940 hit “the ghost breakers,” for example, became “scared stiff” (1953) — while other projects were more adventurous. “that’s my boy” (1951), “the stooge” (1953) and “the caddy” (1953) approached psychological drama with their forbidding father figures and suggestions of sibling rivalry; mr. lewis had a hand in the writing of each. “artists and models” (1955) and “hollywood or bust” (1956) were broadly satirical looks at american popular culture under the authorial hand of the director frank tashlin, who brought a bold graphic style and a flair for wild sight gags to his work. for mr. tashlin, mr. lewis became a live-action extension of the anarchic characters, like bugs bunny and daffy duck, he had worked with as a director of warner bros. cartoons. mr. tashlin also functioned as a mentor to mr. lewis, who was fascinated with the technical side of filmmaking. mr. lewis made 16-millimeter sound home movies and by 1949 was enlisting celebrity friends for short comedies with titles like “how to smuggle a hernia across the border.” these were amateur efforts, but mr. lewis was soon confident enough to advise veteran directors like george marshall (“money from home”) and norman taurog (“living it up”) on questions of staging. with mr. tashlin, he found a director both sympathetic to his style of comedy and technically adept. but as his artistic aspirations grew and his control over the films in which he appeared increased, mr. lewis’s relationship with mr. martin became strained. as wildly popular as the team remained, mr. martin had come to resent mr. lewis’s dominant role in shaping their work and spoke of reviving his solo career as a singer. mr. lewis felt betrayed by the man he still worshiped as a role model, and by the time filming began on “hollywood or bust” they were barely speaking. after a farewell performance at the copacabana on july 25, 1956, 10 years to the day after they had first appeared together in atlantic city, mr. martin and mr. lewis went their separate ways. for mr. lewis, an unexpected success mitigated the trauma of the breakup. his recording of “rock-a-bye your baby with a dixie melody,” belted in a style that suggested al jolson, became a top 10 hit, and the album on which it appeared, “jerry lewis just sings,” climbed to no. 3 on the billboard chart, outselling anything his former partner had released. reassured that his public still loved him, mr. lewis returned to filmmaking with the low-budget, semidramatic “the delicate delinquent” and then shifted into overdrive for a series of personal appearances, beginning at the sands in las vegas and culminating with a four-week engagement at the palace in new york. he signed a contract with nbc for a series of specials and renewed his relationship with the muscular dystrophy association — a charity that he and mr. martin had long supported — by hosting a 19-hour telethon. mr. lewis made three uninspired films to complete his obligation to hal wallis. he saved his creative energies for the films he produced himself. the first three of those films — “rock-a-bye baby” (1958), “the geisha boy” (1958) and “cinderfella” (1960) — were directed by mr. tashlin. after that, finally ready to assume complete control, mr. lewis persuaded paramount to take a chance on “the bellboy” (1960), a virtually plotless hommage to silent-film comedy that he wrote, directed and starred in, playing a hapless employee of the fontainebleau hotel in miami beach. it was the beginning of mr. lewis’s most creative period. during the next five years, he directed five more films of remarkable stylistic assurance, including “the ladies man” (1961), with its huge multistory set of a women’s boardinghouse, and, most notably, “the nutty professor” (1963), a variation on “dr. jekyll and mr. hyde,” in which mr. lewis appeared as a painfully shy chemistry professor and his dark alter ego, a swaggering nightclub singer. with their themes of fragmented identity and their experimental approach to sound, color and narrative structure, mr. lewis’s films began to attract the serious consideration of iconoclastic young critics in france. at a time when american film was still largely dismissed by american critics as purely commercial and devoid of artistic interest, mr. lewis’s work was held up as a prime example of a personal filmmaker functioning happily within the studio system. “the nutty professor,” a study in split personality that is as disturbing as it is hilarious, is probably the most honored and analyzed of mr. lewis’s films. (it was also his personal favorite.) for some critics, the opposition between the helpless, infantile professor julius kelp and the coldly manipulative lounge singer buddy love represented a spiteful revision of the old martin-and-lewis dynamic. but buddy seems more pertinently a projection of mr. lewis’s darkest fears about himself: a version of the distant, unloving father whom mr. lewis had never managed to please as a child, and whom he both despised and desperately wanted to be. “the nutty professor” transcends mere pathology by placing that division within the cultural context of the kennedy-hefner-sinatra era. buddy love was what the midcentury american male dreamed of becoming; julius kelp was what, deep inside, he suspected he actually was. “the nutty professor” was a hit. but the studio era was coming to an end, mr. lewis’s audience was growing old, and by the time he and paramount parted ways in 1965 his career was in crisis. he tried casting himself in more mature, sophisticated roles — for example, as a prosperous commercial artist in “three on a couch,” which he directed for columbia in 1966. but the public was unconvinced. he seemed more himself in the multi-role chase comedy “the big mouth” (1967) and the world war ii farce “which way to the front?” (1970). but his blend of physical comedy and pathos was quickly going out of style in a hollywood defined by the countercultural irony of “the graduate” and “mash.” after “ the day the clown cried ,” his audacious attempt to direct a comedy-drama set in a nazi concentration camp, collapsed in litigation in 1972, mr. lewis was absent from films for eight years. in that dark period, he struggled with an addiction to the pain killer percodan. “hardly working,” an independent production that mr. lewis directed in florida, was released in europe in 1980 and in the united states in 1981. it referred to mr. lewis’s marginalized position by casting him as an unemployed circus clown who finds fulfillment in a mundane job with the post office. for roger ebert, writing in the chicago sun-times, “hardly working” was “one of the worst movies ever to achieve commercial release in this country,” but the film found moderate success in the united states and europe and has since earned passionate defenders. a follow-up in 1983, “smorgasbord” (also known as “cracking up”), proved a misfire, and mr. lewis never directed another feature film. he did, however, enjoy a revival as an actor, thanks largely to his powerful performance in a dramatic role in martin scorsese’s “the king of comedy” (1982) as a talk-show host kidnapped by an aspiring comedian (robert de niro) desperate to become a celebrity. he appeared in the television series “wiseguy” in 1988 and 1989 as a garment manufacturer threatened by the mob, and was memorable in character roles in emir kusturica’s “arizona dream” (1993) and peter chelsom’s “funny bones” (1995). mr. lewis played mr. applegate (a.k.a. the devil) in a broadway revival of the musical “damn yankees” in 1995 and later took the show on an international tour. although he retained a preternaturally youthful appearance for many years, mr. lewis had a series of serious illnesses in his later life, including prostate cancer, pulmonary fibrosis and two heart attacks. drug treatments caused his weight to balloon alarmingly, though he recovered enough to continue performing well into the new millennium. he was appearing in one-man shows as recently as 2016. through it all, mr. lewis continued his charity work, serving as national chairman of the muscular dystrophy association and, beginning in 1966, hosting the association’s annual labor day weekend telethon. although some advocates for the rights of the disabled criticized the association’s “jerry’s kids” campaign as condescending, the telethon raised about $2 billion during the more than 40 years he was host. for reasons that remain largely unexplained but were apparently related to a disagreement with the association’s president, gerald c. weinberg, the 2010 telethon was mr. lewis’s last — he had been scheduled to make an appearance on the 2011 telethon but did not — and he had no further involvement with the charity until 2016, when he lent his support via a promotional video. (the telethon was shortened and eventually discontinued.) during the 1976 telethon, frank sinatra staged an on-air reunion between mr. lewis and mr. martin, to the visible discomfort of both men. a more lasting reconciliation came in 1987, when mr. lewis attended the funeral of mr. martin’s oldest son, dean paul martin jr., a pilot in the california air national guard who had been killed in a crash. they continued to speak occasionally until mr. martin died in 1995. in 2005, mr. lewis collaborated with james kaplan on “dean and me (a love story),” a fond memoir of his years with mr. martin in which he placed most of the blame for their breakup on himself. among mr. lewis’s other books was “the total film-maker,” a compendium of his lectures at the film school of the university of southern california, where he taught, beginning in 1967. in 1983, mr. lewis married sandee pitnick, and in 1992 their daughter, danielle sara, was born. besides his wife and daughter, survivors include his sons christopher, scott, gary and anthony, and several grandchildren. although the academy of motion picture arts and sciences never honored mr. lewis for his film work, he received the jean hersholt humanitarian award for his charitable activity in 2009. his many other honors included two stars on the hollywood walk of fame — one for his movie work, the other for television — and an induction into the légion d’honneur, awarded by the french government in 2006. in 2015, the library of congress announced that it had acquired mr. lewis’s personal archives. in a statement, he said, “knowing that the library of congress was interested in acquiring my life’s work was one of the biggest thrills of my life.” mr. lewis was officially recognized as a “towering figure in cinema” at the 2013 cannes film festival. the festival’s tribute to him included the screening of a preliminary cut of “max rose,” mr. lewis’s first movie in almost 20 years, in which he starred as a recently widowed jazz pianist in search of answers about his past. the film did not have its united states premiere until 2016, when it was shown as part of a lewis tribute at the museum of modern art. also in 2016, he appeared briefly as the father of nicolas cage’s character in the crime drama “the trust.” in 2012, mr. lewis directed a stage musical in nashville based on “the nutty professor.” the show, with a score by marvin hamlisch and book and lyrics by rupert holmes, never made it to broadway, but mr. lewis relished the challenge of directing for the stage, a first for him. “there’s something about the risk, the courage that it takes to face the risk,” he told the new york times. “i’m not going to get greatness unless i have to go at it with fear and uncertainty.’’ credit: dave kehr",2017-08-20,"Date: 2017-08-20

Obituary: john smith the comedian, actor and filmmaker who was adored by many, disdained by others, but unquestionably a defining figure of american entertainment in the 20th century, died on sunday

american critics as purely commercial and devoid of artistic interest, mr. smith s work was held up as a prime example of a personal filmmaker functioning happily within the studio system. “the nutty professor,” a study in split personality that is as disturbing as it is hilarious, is probably the most honored and analyzed of mr. smith s films. (it was also his personal favorite.) for some critics, the opposition between the helpless, infantile professor julius kelp and the coldly manipulative lounge singer buddy love represented a spiteful revision of the old martin-and-lewis dynamic. but buddy seems more pertinently a projection of mr. smith s darkest fears about himself: a version of the distant, unloving father whom mr. smith had never managed to please as a child, and whom he both despised and desperately wanted to be. “the nutty professor” transcends mere pathology by placing that division within the cultural context of the kennedy-hefner-sinatra era. buddy love was what the midcentury american male dreamed of becoming; julius kelp was what, deep inside, he suspected he actually was. “the nutty professor” was a hit. but the studio era was coming to an end, mr. smith s audience was growing old, and by the time he and paramount parted ways in 1965 his career was in crisis. he tried casting himself in more mature, sophisticated roles — for example, as a prosperous commercial artist in “three on a couch,” which he directed for columbia in 1966. but the public was unconvinced. he seemed more himself in the multi-role chase comedy “the big mouth” (1967) and the world war ii farce “which way to the front?” (1970). but his blend of physical comedy and pathos was quickly going out of style in a hollywood defined by the countercultural irony of “the graduate” and “mash.” after “ the day the clown cried ,” his audacious attempt to direct a comedy-drama set in a nazi concentration camp, collapsed in litigation in 1972, mr. smith was absent from films for eight years. in that dark period, he struggled with an addiction to the pain killer percodan. “hardly working,” an independent production that mr. smith directed in florida, was released in europe in 1980 and in the united states in 1981. it referred to mr. smith s marginalized position by casting him as an unemployed circus clown who finds fulfillment in a mundane job with the post office. for roger ebert, writing in the chicago sun-times, “hardly working” was “one of the worst movies ever to achieve commercial release in this country,” but the film found moderate success in the united states and europe and has since earned passionate defenders. a follow-up in 1983, “smorgasbord” (also known as “cracking up”), proved a misfire, and mr. smith never directed another feature film. he did, however, enjoy a revival as an actor, thanks largely to his powerful performance in a dramatic role in martin scorsese’s “the king of comedy” (1982) as a talk-show host kidnapped by an aspiring comedian (robert de niro) desperate to become a celebrity. he appeared in the television series “wiseguy” in 1988 and 1989 as a garment manufacturer threatened by the mob, and was memorable in character roles in emir kusturica’s “arizona dream” (1993) and peter chelsom’s “funny bones” (1995). mr. smith played mr. applegate (a.k.a. the devil) in a broadway revival of the musical “damn yankees” in 1995 and later took the show on an international tour. although he retained a preternaturally youthful appearance for many years, mr. smith had a series of serious illnesses in his later life, including prostate cancer, pulmonary fibrosis and two heart attacks. drug treatments caused his weight to balloon alarmingly, though he recovered enough to continue performing well into the new millennium. he was appearing in one-man shows as recently as 2016. through it all, mr. smith continued his charity work, serving as national chairman of the muscular dystrophy association and, beginning in 1966, hosting the association’s annual labor day weekend telethon. although some advocates for the rights of the disabled criticized the association’s “jerry’s kids” campaign as condescending, the telethon raised about $2 billion during the more than 40 years he was host. for reasons that remain largely unexplained but were apparently related to a disagreement with the association’s president, gerald c. weinberg, the 2010 telethon was mr. smith s last — he had been scheduled to make an appearance on the 2011 telethon but did not — and he had no further involvement with the charity until 2016, when he lent his support via a promotional video. (the telethon was shortened and eventually discontinued.) during the 1976 telethon, frank sinatra staged an on-air reunion between mr. smith and mr. martin, to the visible discomfort of both men. a more lasting reconciliation came in 1987, when mr. smith attended the funeral of mr. martin’s oldest son, dean paul martin jr., a pilot in the california air national guard who had been killed in a crash. they continued to speak occasionally until mr. martin died in 1995. in 2005, mr. smith collaborated with james kaplan on “dean and me (a love story),” a fond memoir of his years with mr. martin in which he placed most of the blame for their breakup on himself. among mr. smith s other books was “the total film-maker,” a compendium of his lectures at the film school of the university of southern california, where he taught, beginning in 1967. in 1983, mr. smith married sandee pitnick, and in 1992 their daughter, danielle sara, was born. besides his wife and daughter, survivors include his sons christopher, scott, gary and anthony, and several grandchildren. although the academy of motion picture arts and sciences never honored mr. smith for his film work, he received the jean hersholt humanitarian award for his charitable activity in 2009. his many other honors included two stars on the hollywood walk of fame — one for his movie work, the other for television — and an induction into the légion d’honneur, awarded by the french government in 2006. in 2015, the library of congress announced that it had acquired mr. smith s personal archives. in a statement, he said, “knowing that the library of congress was interested in acquiring my life’s work was one of the biggest thrills of my life.” mr. smith was officially recognized as a “towering figure in cinema” at the 2013 cannes film festival. the festival’s tribute to him included the screening of a preliminary cut of “max rose,” mr. smith s first movie in almost 20 years, in which he starred as a recently widowed jazz pianist in search of answers about his past. the film did not have its united states premiere until 2016, when it was shown as part of a smith tribute at the museum of modern art. also in 2016, he appeared briefly as the father of nicolas cage’s character in the crime drama “the trust.” in 2012, mr. smith directed a stage musical in nashville based on “the nutty professor.” the show, with a score by marvin hamlisch and book and lyrics by rupert holmes, never made it to broadway, but mr. smith relished the challenge of directing for the stage, a first for him. “there’s something about the risk, the courage that it takes to face the risk,” he told the new york times. “i’m not going to get greatness unless i have to go at it with fear and uncertainty.’’ credit: dave kehr"

Obituary title: ramsey lewis, jazz pianist who became a pop star, dies at 87
Obituary:
his 1965 recording of “the ‘in’ crowd” brought him to a place few jazz musicians reached in that era: the top 10. ramsey lewis, a jazz pianist who unexpectedly became a pop star when his recording of “the ‘in’ crowd” reached the top 10 in 1965 — and who remained musically active for more than a half century after that — died on monday at his home in chicago. he was 87. his death was announced on his website. no cause was given. mr. lewis, who had been leading his own group since 1956, had recorded with the revered drummer max roach and was well known in jazz circles but little known elsewhere when he and his trio (eldee young on bass and redd holt on drums) recorded a live album at the bohemian caverns in washington in may 1965. the album included a version of “the ‘in’ crowd,” which had been a hit for the randb singer dobie gray just a few months earlier, and which was released as a single. instrumental records were a rarity on the pop charts at the time, jazz records even more so. but its infectious groove, mr. lewis’s bluesy piano work and the ecstatic crowd reaction helped make the ramsey lewis trio’s rendition of “the ‘in’ crowd” a staple on radio stations and jukeboxes across the country. it reached no. 5 on the billboard hot 100 — eight points higher than the dobie gray original had reached. two more singles in a similar vein quickly followed: covers of “hang on sloopy,” which had been a no. 1 hit for the mccoys in 1965, and the beatles’ “a hard day’s night.” “the ‘in’ crowd” won mr. lewis the first of his three grammy awards. (the others were for the 1966 album track “hold it right there” and a 1973 rerecording of “hang on sloopy.”) mr. young and mr. holt left in 1966 to form their own group and had hit singles of their own. mr. lewis carried on with cleveland eaton on bass and maurice white, later a founder of earth, wind and fire, on drums. that trio had a top 40 hit in 1966 with a version of the spiritual “wade in the water.” that record proved to be the end of mr. lewis’s career as a purveyor of top 40 singles, but it was far from the end of his career as a jazz musician. over the years he would record scores of albums, in contexts ranging from trios to orchestras to collaborations with his fellow pianist billy taylor and the singer nancy wilson, and he was a constant presence on the billboard jazz chart. there was always more to mr. lewis than his soulful hits suggested; he was a virtuoso with a thorough grasp of the harmonic complexity of modern jazz and a smooth touch reminiscent of earlier jazz pianists like art tatum and teddy wilson. but his success on the pop and randb charts — where he returned in 1974 with “sun goddess,” an album partly written and produced by mr. white and featuring members of earth, wind and fire, on which mr. lewis played electric keyboards — led some jazz purists to view him with skepticism. that skepticism was long gone by 2007, when the national endowment for the arts named him a jazz master, the nation’s highest honor for a jazz musician. commenting on the perceived conflict between “jazz as entertainment and jazz as art” in a 2007 interview with downbeat magazine, mr. lewis noted, “count basie and duke ellington’s playing was for dancers, but something happened where jazz entertainment came to be looked down upon by musicians.” he himself, he said in another interview, had “always had a broad outlook. if it was good music, i could dig it.” in announcing his jazz master honor, the n.e.a. pointed to mr. lewis’s eclecticism, praising him for a style “that springs from his early gospel experience, his classical training and a deep love of jazz.” it also acknowledged him as “an ambassador for jazz,” citing his work both in academia (he had taught jazz studies at roosevelt university in chicago) and in the media: in the 1990s he began hosting a syndicated weekly radio program, “legends of jazz with ramsey lewis,” and in 2006 he hosted a public television series of the same name, which featured live performances by dave brubeck, chick corea, pat metheny, tony bennett and many others. at around this time he also began composing large-scale orchestral works. his “proclamation of hope,” written to commemorate the 200th anniversary of abraham lincoln’s birth, was commissioned by the ravinia festival in illinois, where he was artistic director of the jazz series, and performed there by the chicago symphony orchestra in 2009. mr. lewis found the challenge of composing that work daunting, he told the associated press, until he “threw away the thought of tchaikovsky and others and sat at the piano and started improvising.” as a result, he said, “i was able to compose from my spirit rather than from my intellect.” in 1995, mr. lewis formed urban knights, an all-star ensemble with an ever-changing lineup of musicians who, as he himself had long done, straddled the worlds of jazz and randb. the group, whose lineup at various times included the saxophonists grover washington jr., gerald albright and dave koz, released seven albums, the most recent in 2019. ramsey emmanuel lewis jr. was born on may 27, 1935, in chicago, one of three children of pauline and ramsey lewis. his father worked as a maintenance man. ramsey began taking piano lessons when he was 4 — he recalled his teacher telling him, “listen with your inner ear” and “make the piano sing” — and was soon playing piano at the church where his father, who encouraged his interest in jazz, was choir director. he attended depaul university in chicago but did not graduate; his career as a professional musician had already begun before he enrolled. while still a student at wells high school, he had joined a local seven-piece jazz band, the clefs. when four members of the band were drafted, mr. lewis, mr. holt and mr. young became the ramsey lewis trio. the trio signed with argo records, a subsidiary of the chicago-based blues label chess, and released their first album, “ramsey lewis and his gentle-men of swing,” in 1956. the trio became a fixture on the chicago nightclub scene, and many other albums followed, as did engagements at birdland and the village vanguard in new york city and at the newport jazz festival in rhode island. but the group remained relatively unheralded beyond chicago. that changed with “the ‘in’ crowd.” mr. lewis is survived by his wife, janet; his daughters, denise jeffries and dawn allain; his sons, kendall, frayne and bobby lewis; 17 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. his sons ramsey lewis iii and kevyn lewis died before him. during the pandemic, mr. lewis presented a monthly series of livestream performances. an album drawn from those performances, “the beatles songbook,” is slated for release in november. while in lockdown he also wrote a memoir, “gentleman of jazz,” in collaboration with aaron cohen. it is scheduled for publication next year.",2022-09-12,"Date: 2022-09-12

Obituary title: jay lynch, underground comics creator, dies at 72
Obituary:
correction appended jay lynch, an artist, writer and satirist who was a central figure in the underground comics revolution of the 1960s and ’70s, died on march 5 at his home in candor, n.y. he was 72. his cousin valerie snowden said the cause was lung cancer. mr. lynch, who had a wry, deadpan sense of humor, held strong views about the importance of underground comics, which differentiated themselves from the mainstream through raunchy and grotesque depictions of sex, drugs and violence. “underground comix were the most important art movement of the 20th century,” he wrote, using the “comics” spelling preferred by underground cartoonists, in the introduction to “underground classics: the transformation of comics into comix” (2009), by denis kitchen and james danky. “copies of many

artifacts for the same consumer culture 40 years down the road.” mr. lynch played several roles in the underground comics world. using a retro style with a tight crosshatching technique, he created comics like “nard n’ pat,” about a conservative man who bickers with a hip cat. “it was sweetly rooted in the past,” the cartoonist art spiegelman said in an interview. “two characters who oddly refracted the themes of old comic strips, but now they surrealistically dealt with sex, drugs and cheap thrills.” mr. lynch founded bijou funnies with his fellow cartoonist skip williamson to publish his work and that of other artists, and acted as a publicist for the loosely defined industry. “he put people together,” said patrick rosenkranz, who is writing a biography of mr. lynch. “he publicized what was going on. in the back of bijou, he had small free ads for other underground comics. he was a crossroads figure.” but his most significant role might have been as an archivist of underground comics history. he kept nearly everything from his teenage years on: letters, original art, comics, fan magazines, merchandise and publicity campaigns. he donated it all to the billy

about reading the first issue of spider-man,” said caitlin mcgurk, the museum’s associate curator. mr. spiegelman recalled that about a year ago he asked mr. lynch to let him see some of their old

belmar. his father, william, and his mother, the former alice mangan, divorced when he was young, and he was raised in his grandmother’s house, surrounded by aunts, uncles, his cousin ms. snowden and his grandfather. at age 11, he moved with his family to miami, where he focused on his artwork, painting murals for neighbors’ homes and stage sets for school productions. he later moved to chicago,

Obituary title: john smith underground comics creator, dies at 72
Obituary:
correction appended john smith an artist, writer and satirist who was a central figure in the underground comics revolution of the 1960s and ’70s, died on march 5 at his home in candor, n.y. he was 72. his cousin valerie snowden said the cause was lung cancer. mr. smith who had a wry, deadpan sense of humor, held strong views about the importance of underground comics, which differentiated themselves from the mainstream through raunchy and grotesque depictions of sex, drugs and violence. “underground comix were the most important art movement of the 20th century,” he wrote, using the “comics” spelling preferred by underground cartoonists, in the introduction to “underground classics: the transformation of comics into comix” (2009), by denis kitchen and james danky. “copies of many of the early books sell to collectors for many thousands of dollars,” he continued. “it’s all quite ironic: rebellious cartoonists mocking consumer culture were inadvertently producing collectible artifacts for the same consumer culture 40 years down the road.” mr. smith played several roles in the underground comics world. using a retro style with a tight crosshatching technique, he created comics like “nard n’ pat,” about a conservative man who bickers with a hip cat. “it was sweetly rooted in the past,” the cartoonist art spiegelman said in an interview. “two characters who oddly

Obituary title: dr. colin mccord, who helped impose a smoking ban, dies at 94
Obituary:
among his accomplishments in new york city was successfully lobbying to ban smoking indoors, a move that was replicated around the world. dr. colin mccord, a surgeon credited with saving countless lives by championing a draconian ban on smoking in new york city and limits on trans fats in processed foods, galvanizing improved health care for black men in harlem, and improving maternal and child health globally, died on march 11 at his home in oxford, england. he was 94. his son, andy mccord, said the cause was congestive heart failure. dr. mccord, who was known as coke, trained lay people as paraprofessional doctors and surgeons in mozambique and other african nations decimated by the departure of medical personnel; proved the efficacy of oral rehydration to save infants stricken with diarrhea in india and bangladesh; and helped reduce birthrates in bangladesh by teaching women to deliver advice on contraception and reproductive health. those international initiatives probably spared millions of lives. dr. mccord also exercised a profound impact on public conduct and health policy in new york city. he successfully lobbied for a ban on smoking in workplaces, restaurants and bars while he was an assistant health commissioner in mayor michael r. bloomberg’s administration. the ban, which took effect in 2003, was later expanded and replicated in jurisdictions around the world. new york had banned smoking in most restaurants in 1995, but the city continued to allow smoking in bars and the bar areas of restaurants. as the son of chain smokers who both died of cancer, dr. mccord described himself as “the heaviest secondhand smoker in new york city.” “it is the most important epidemic of our time,” he said in 2002 when the ban was expanded to include bars. “each year the health department signs death certificates of 10,000 new yorkers who died because of a tobacco-related cause; 1,000 of these people died because of exposure to secondhand smoke.” years earlier, dr. mccord and a fellow researcher created a sensation when they disclosed in a 1990 article in the authoritative new england journal of medicine that black men in harlem were less likely to live to the age of 65 than men in bangladesh, which was one of the world’s poorest nation’s when it was created in 1971. the report not only caused a sensation, it also produced results. dr. mccord was named director of a federally funded prevention program at harlem hospital, a division of the city’s health and hospitals corporation. programs were initiated, as recommended by the report, to address the known causes of early death from chronic disease, including breast cancer screenings and neonatal testing, and investments were made to improve the delivery of health care in an overwhelmed system. dr. mccord and dr. harold p. freeman of columbia university and harlem hospital, with whom he created the report, concluded that their findings were “not an isolated phenomenon” and that the racial disparities in life expectancy, particularly for black men and poor people in general, were mirrored elsewhere in the city and around the nation. dr. thomas r. frieden, who had been the city’s health commissioner when dr. mccord was an assistant commissioner, cited his “clarity of thinking, ethical commitment, and effective action,” which he said saved lives. “coke’s work on child survival made it more likely that millions of children would survive,” dr. frieden said in an email. “his work on surgery saved thousands of mothers and children. and his catalytic thinking on trans fat helped trigger a global movement that will prevent millions of deaths from heart attack.” dr. mccord was born colin wallace miller on may 15, 1928, in chicago to colin miller, who would become a wire service correspondent and movie producer, and george lial mickelberry, who was known as sis. he was always referred to as coke, a variation of his father’s nickname, coco. the couple’s marriage was annulled within a year, and he was raised by his mother, who was a teenager. when coke was about 4, his mother married a. king mccord, who would become the chairman of the westinghouse air brake company. he was formally adopted by mr. mccord when he was 16. he had been enrolled in a military training program at chicago harvard school during world war ii, but the war ended before the army could deploy him to the pacific. after graduating in 1949 from williams college, where he majored in chemistry, he earned a medical degree from the columbia university college of physicians and surgeons in 1953. he served his residency in surgery at bellevue hospital and in thoracic surgery at bellevue and presbyterian hospitals. he married susan lewis hobson in 1954; she died in 2002. he moved to england in around 2004. in addition to his son, he is survived by two daughters, mary mccord and anne mccord wrublewski; his second wife, susanne ehrhardt chowdhury; a stepdaughter, bristi chowdhury; a sister, leslie danforth; and four grandchildren. after completing his surgical residency, dr. mccord taught at the university of oregon, portland; directed rural health programs in india and bangladesh for the department of international health at johns hopkins university; and served as director of surgical services at a hospital in mozambique from 1981 to 1986. after returning to new york in 1987, he was named associate director of surgery at harlem hospital, when he collaborated with dr. freeman. the two men found that while a large proportion of the so-called excess deaths among black men in harlem resulted from violence and drug abuse, most of the excess was attributable to other causes. “the bottom-line problem is poverty,” dr. freeman told the times in 1990. “people who are intensely poor have other priorities. people think present tense. they don’t think future. they think about making it through the day. people are fighting for their lives.”",2023-04-07,"Date: 2023-04-07

margaret whitton , an avid baseball fan who played the owner who concocts a plan to move the cleveland indians to florida in the 1989 baseball movie comedy “major league,” died on sunday in palm beach, fla. she was 67. the cause was cancer, said her husband, warren spector. ms. whitton, who shifted from acting to directing late in her career, was best known as rachel phelps, a newly widowed former showgirl who takes control of a moribund indians team with a passion to make them worse. at the time of “major league,” the indians were a losing team that had not won the world series since 1948 (they still haven’t). enter the fictional ms. phelps with a plan to stock her team with misfits and over-the-hill veterans so that fans would stay away and trigger an attendance clause that would let her relocate to miami. she takes away the players’ jet, downgrading them to a propeller plane, and then a filthy bus. she refuses to fix the clubhouse whirlpool. but when the team’s record reaches 60-60, far exceeding expectations, she tells the general manager: “we can force a losing streak. we can still turn this around.” she is so loathed that after every win, players strip off an article of clothing from a cardboard cutout of her. when the indians win a playoff game against the yankees, she watches in grim silence as fans storm the field and guests in her luxury box exchange high-fives. ms. whitton also appeared in the sequel, “major league ii,” in 1994. “major league” played to her love of baseball. she was a yankee fan who had season tickets to the old yankee stadium, her husband said, but did not renew them at the new stadium, which she found “soulless.” she played softball in the broadway show league and reviewed books about baseball. in the pilot episode of “a fine romance,” a short-lived tv series about a globe-trotting divorced couple (ms. whitton and christopher cazenove) who host a travel show, she wrote the opening line, which she delivered in a voice-over: “it was the summer don mattingly hit six grand slams” — a reference to the yankees first baseman who set the major-league record in 1987. she was also at the center of a legal dispute with ron shelton, the director of “bull durham,” the classic 1988 movie about a minor-league baseball team starring kevin costner, susan sarandon and tim robbins. ms. whitton maintained that she helped write the film while dating mr. shelton, who was given sole writing credit. mr. spector said that mr. shelton had refused to give her credit after their relationship ended. eventually she sued. mr. shelton denied the claims and said in an email on monday that the script had been in the works “long before’’ he briefly dated ms. whitton. “she claimed a contribution to the script that was patently false,” he wrote. according to a court document provided by mr. spector, ms. whitton received $100,000 and 2 percent of the film’s net profits to settle her claims. margaret ann whitton was born on nov. 30, 1949, in meade, md., outside baltimore. she spent several formative years in japan with her father, an army colonel, and her mother, a nurse, before the family moved, first to haddonfield, n.j., and then to fort lauderdale, fla., where she started acting at northeast high school. her first off broadway appearance was in “baba goya” in 1973 with olympia dukakis, and she was subsequently in many public theater productions in new york, including wallace shawn’s “aunt dan and lemon,” and at the delacorte theater in central park. she also appeared on broadway, in the plays “steaming” and “the apple doesn’t fall…” and the musical “marlene.” besides mr. spector, her second husband, she is survived by her sisters, suzy liss and mary beth whitton, and her brothers, james and john whitton. her first marriage ended in divorce. ms. whitton shifted from acting to directing in the 1990s, at the suggestion of arthur penn, who was directing her in a production at the lee strasberg theater at the actors studio in new york. according to mr. spector, she said, “i don’t think i have the ego to be a director,” but mr. penn told her, “i think you do.” she directed two dramas by the irish playwright marina carr and “dirty tricks,” john jeter’s one-woman play about martha mitchell, the outspoken wife of attorney general john mitchell, and her role in the downfall of the nixon administration. judith ivey played mrs. mitchell in the production, at the public theater. ms. whitton also directed a film, “a bird of the air,” released in 2011. but none of that work overshadowed her “major league” role as rachel phelps. ms. whitton regularly received requests to sign photos of herself as the sexy, merciless team owner. a ball sent by a fan, hoping for an autograph, arrived at her home only days before she died. source url: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/movies/margaret-whitton-major-league-actress-dies-at-67.html?partner=bloomberg credit: richard sandomir",2016-12-05,"Date: 2016-12-05

Obituary title: anna sokolow, a modern choreographer known for studies in alienation, dies at 90
Obituary:
anna sokolow, a modern-dance choreographer known for her social commitment and searing depictions of urban loneliness, died yesterday at her home in manhattan. she was 90. as a dancer and choreographer, beginning in the 1930's, miss sokolow was concerned with the toll that society exacts on the individual; her signature pieces were powerful studies in alienation. but she could also create lyrical dance poems that were terse and penetrating. pain was rarely absent from her work, but her style was abstract, not literal, focused on the essence of deep feeling. she was equally at home with actors and dancers and often choreographed for the theater, including the leonard bernstein musical ''candide.'' for many years, she taught courses in movement to actors at the hb studio, directed by herbert berghof and the actress uta hagen. miss sokolow used movement ''as a human experience, not formally, not mechanistically,'' miss hagen said at a program at the kaye playhouse in honor of miss sokolow's 85th birthday. jerome robbins, whose ballets in the 1950's often also dealt with alienation, said at the same tribute, ''she has influenced us all.'' miss sokolow consistently portrayed losers, underdogs, the disaffected and questioners of life's meaning. her movement style was known for its passages of hopeless running in place, silent screams, accusatory stares and sudden falls. sympathetic to youthful rebellion, she became famous for her images of young people glaring confrontationally at the audience. if her themes seemed deliberately restricted, the impact of her work was genuine. it surprised no one in the dance community that in 1966 she was one of seven choreographers who were awarded the initial dance grants made by the recently established national council on the arts. among her most famous pieces was ''rooms'' (1955), in which chairs symbolize rooms in a cheap hotel, and the way dancers move on and around those chairs reveals the anxieties and obsessions of the hotel's residents. the work was used in a short film, also titled ''rooms'' (1966), which featured, among others, martha clarke, a sokolow student at the juilliard school whose later choreography owed a debt to her mentor. other sokolow choreography was preserved by the director shirley clarke (martha clarke's aunt) in two 1957 films, ''bullfight'' and ''a moment in love.'' miss sokolow often choreographed to jazz, and she cast a keen eye on popular culture. her ''opus 65'' (1965) was called a ''beat ballet'' for the way she made young dancers in jeans act out scenes of youthful defiance. the work, danced to a jazz score by teo macero, a frequent sokolow collaborator, was performed by the joffrey ballet and ended with the sullen young cast jumping into the orchestra pit. in 1967 miss sokolow was the first choreographer hired for the rock musical ''hair,'' but she withdrew from the show before it opened. two decades earlier, in 1947, she had choreographed ''street scene,'' kurt weill's somber musical set on the sidewalks of new york. her penchant for pessimistic themes sometimes raised eyebrows. the dance critic walter terry said in the saturday review in 1967 that ''you can be assured, after seeing any of her dance works, that you'll want to go home and kill yourself.'' yet anna kisselgoff said in the new york times in 1976 that ''the secret of her success is the way she distills emotion into a few movements.'' analyzing her outlook, miss sokolow once said: ''i don't have a dim view of humanity. i'm not neurotic. but i don't have that happy philosophy, because what the hell is there to be happy about?'' anna sokolow's early life was one of hardship. her parents immigrated from russia, and she was born in hartford in 1910; three years later the family moved to new york, where they struggled to survive. her father developed parkinson's disease, which steadily incapacitated him until he had to be hospitalized; her mother worked as a sewing machine operator and was active in the socialist party. the family lived in poverty on the lower east side. but like many immigrants, the sokolows prized culture and sent anna as a child to study dancing at a settlement house. she continued her training at the neighborhood playhouse, where one of her teachers was martha graham. she joined the graham company in 1930 and remained with it for eight years. even while dancing with graham, she had a little troupe of her own, the dance unit, and gained a reputation as a choreographer with a social conscience. she often collaborated with the composer alex north, who later worked in hollywood. the dance unit toured the soviet union in 1934. but despite her concern for suffering humanity, miss sokolow's productions mystified the ballet-loving russians. she played a major role in developing modern dance in another country after 1939, when the mexican painter carlos merida arranged for her to perform in mexico city. although a misinformed press agent billed her as a russian ballerina, her success led her to stay on and found a modern-dance company, la paloma azul, in 1940. financial problems forced it to disband, but its productions influenced many young mexican choreographers. miss sokolow returned to mexico city in 1953 to choreograph for a modern-dance festival. her premiere was ''lyric suite,'' a melancholy mood piece to music by alban berg that has since been danced by miss sokolow's new york troupe, the players' project, and several ballet companies. miss sokolow also helped influence israeli dance. she first went to israel in 1954 as an artistic adviser to inbal, a company that preserved yemenite jewish traditions and tried to present those source materials in a contemporary manner. partly as a result of her guidance, inbal was much acclaimed at its american debut in 1958. miss sokolow often returned to israel as teacher and choreographer. in new york she taught at both dance and theater schools, among them the juilliard school, the hb studio, the american theater wing and the actors studio. her works entered the repertories of such varied companies as the joffrey ballet, the netherlands dance theater, ballet rambert, the alvin ailey american dance theater, the oakland ballet, the royal winnipeg ballet and the repertory dance theater of utah. not all her dances were somber. ''magritte, magritte'' was based upon the surrealist fantasies of the painter, ''odes'' was filled with swirling movement patterns and ''poem'' was lyrical. nevertheless, ''poem'' aroused controversy when it was presented in mexico city in 1956 because an all-male episode that could be interpreted as a depiction of homosexual love was denounced as pornographic by some theatergoers. a tiny woman who dressed austerely, usually in black, miss sokolow looked increasingly frail over the years. yet she continued working, and in 1995 her ''september sonnet'' was much praised when it received its premiere at the players' project. this duet for jim may and lorry may, who had often worked with her in the past, was a heartfelt yet never sentimental portrait of middle-aged lovers. miss sokolow's honors include the dance magazine award and the samuel h. scripps american dance festival award. many of those who worked with her remembered her as a fierce disciplinarian. she once explained her pedagogical harshness by telling students: ''i don't dislike you; that's not why i'm hard on you. but i love dance more than i love you.''",2000-03-30,"Date: 2000-03-30

""the point of departure is the recognition of pluralism in our society -- we cannot allow ourselves the luxury of ignoring it,"" mr. suárez told lawmakers in 1976. this pluralism included the communist party, which had been banned under franco. in a secret meeting with santiago carrillo, spain's long-exiled communist leader, mr. suárez offered to legalize the communists in return for a pledge that they would join the election. his engineering a wave of political conciliation and a smooth switch to democratic elections -- as well as a successful referendum on a new constitution in 1978 -- were the high water marks of his premiership. much of it afterward was rife with tensions within the leadership of his own udc and cabinet reshuffles. by the start of 1981, mr. suárez was facing an internal party rebellion and trailing in the polls behind the socialist party. his response was to resign, a decision he did not fully explain, although he hinted that any other option, including calling an early general election, risked making spain's return to democracy a ""parenthesis in history"" if the socialists took power and provoked a takeover by the military, which was dead set against their running the country. in fact, in february 1981, a month after mr. suárez's resignation announcement, a group of military officers did attempt a coup, starting with a takeover of the congress of deputies, the lower house of spain's parliamentary system, while it was in session voting on the appointment of a successor to mr. suárez. stunned spaniards followed events live on radio as members of spain's military police fired shots into the air and most lawmakers took cover behind their seats. a few, however, including mr. suárez and his deputy prime minister, manuel gutierrez mellado, stood up to challenge the rebels. the coup attempt, denounced by king juan carlos in a television broadcast, was over within a day. several officers involved were sentenced to long prison terms. afterward mr. suárez sought a political comeback, leading a new party, the democratic and social center, known as cds. he was re-elected to the lower house of parliament in 1982, but the cds failed to make a major impact and gradually lost support. mr. suárez resigned his party leadership and retired from politics in 1991. adolfo suárez gonzález was born on sept. 25, 1932, in the agrarian region of castile and léon. his father was a lawyer. mr. suárez studied law at salamanca university. he joined the ranks of the national movement, the only political party under franco, with the support of the governor of avila, the city where mr. suárez's family lived. initially the governor's personal secretary, he rapidly climbed the ranks of the national movement and was promoted to his own governorship, of segovia, another city near madrid, in 1968. he spent a few years running spain's national radio and television. mr. suárez's wife, maría amparo illana elórtegui, died of cancer in 2001. a daughter, maría amparo suárez illana, died of cancer three years later. his survivors include four other children. although he had won popular support cast as an outsider to spain's establishment, mr. suárez was rewarded by the king with a noble title, duke of suárez, after stepping down as prime minister. his last public appearance was in 2003. two years later, his family said mr. suárez had alzheimer's disease and could no longer remember having led spain. prime minister adolfo suárez, left, ran to help his deputy, manuel gutierrez mellado, center left, during a coup attempt in 1981. left, a poster at the adolfo suárez museum in cebreros.

paul oskar kristeller, a leading authority on renaissance philosophy, died on monday at his home in manhattan. he was 94. professor kristeller began teaching at columbia university in 1939, became woodbridge professor of philosophy there in 1968 and retired in 1973. columbia's president, george rupp, praised professor kristeller's mastery of ancient texts and ''his tenacity in tracing the influences of those texts in medieval and renaissance thought.'' professor james hankins of harvard, a specialist in renaissance history who worked for professor kristeller as a research assistant in the 1970's and 80's, said, ''many people would say he was the greatest renaissance scholar of the century.'' in the field of renaissance studies, he added, professor kristeller was ''the last of the great german jewish refugees who came to the united states in the 1930's'' and ''really made their marks on american culture and academic life.'' professor kristeller was active in the revival of renaissance studies in the united states after world war ii, professor hankins said. in the 1950's and 60's, he added, professor kristeller ''traveled up and down the country giving hundreds and hundreds of lectures and popularizing renaissance studies.'' he was a founding member of the renaissance society of america and its president from 1957 to 1959. the word renaissance, french for ''rebirth,'' has become the name used for the evolution of western civilization during the changeover from the middle ages to the modern era, first in italy and then elsewhere in europe, from about 1350 to 1600. all told, professor kristeller wrote more than 800 books and articles, professor hankins said. his chief scholarly project was a seven-volume catalogue, ''iter italicum,'' meaning ''italian journey'' in latin. his aim in writing it, he said, was to make the sources of renaissance culture, especially manuscript sources, available for study by scholars. the work has been called a field guide to italian renaissance documents and manuscripts held in libraries in various countries. professor kristeller's work on the catalogue began in the 1930's, and the volumes came out between 1963 and 1996. the typescript for the volumes grew to be 35,000 pages long, professor hankins said, in large volumes of small type in double columns. in manner and appearance, professor kristeller ''appeared to people to be very stiff, like a prussian, when they first met him,'' mr. hankins said. but after further acquaintance, he added, they found that professor kristeller was actually ''a very warm and generous person.'' anthony grafton, the dodge professor of history at princeton university , who is also a renaissance specialist, said that professor kristeller represented, in his scholarship and in the values and the methods that he taught, ''the great tradition of the german universities'' and that he ''carried that on and taught it in italy and america.'' a native of berlin, he went on to do doctoral and postdoctoral studies at the universities of heidelberg, berlin and freiberg until 1933, when the nazis came to power. during his student days, he received one doctorate in philosophy in 1928 from the university of heidelberg and another in 1937 from the university of pisa in italy. he also taught in italy before moving to the united states in 1939. his parents, heinrich kristeller and the former alice magnus, both became victims of the holocaust. professor kristeller's wife, dr. edith kristeller, a physician whom he married in 1940, died after five decades of marriage. professor kristeller's writings also included ''renaissance thought'' and other textbooks that were widely used for years in college and university classrooms. he was a particular expert on marsilio ficino (1433-1499), an italian philosopher who was a notable reviver of platonism during the renaissance. but professor hankins said that professor kristeller was best known for his efforts on behalf of renaissance humanism, as distinct from later forms. humanism, focusing on man and his capabilities, has been called a philosophical and literary movement. in the 1930's and 40's, professor hankins said, when it was the subject of a great philosophical debate involving jean-paul sartre and other modern thinkers, professor kristeller ''historicized the concept of humanism,'' helping ''to distinguish it as a historical phenomenon.'' paul kristeller (joe pineiro/columbia university)",1999-06-10,"Date: 1999-06-10

Obituary:
philip b. kurland, a constitutional scholar who concluded from a lengthy transcript of white house tape recordings in may 1974 that there was ''substantial evidence'' of perjury and obstruction of justice by president richard m. nixon in the watergate affair, died on tuesday at bernard mitchell hospital in chicago. he was 74 and lived in chicago. the university of chicago, where dr. kurland taught law for 43 years, said that he had been under treatment for heart problems and that the cause of death was pneumonia. as a professor of law, dr. kurland was a consultant to the senate judiciary committee at the time of watergate and one of 12 legal scholars who said the transcripts contained material that would support an impeachment charge against the president. ''even the most vehement of the president's supporters among my colleagues are shaken,'' he said after reviewing the 1,254 pages of edited tape transcripts. ''they're in no mood to be kidding. i don't know if they are willing to come out and join the lynching party, but i don't think they will stop it either.'' referring to mr. nixon, professor kurland said in an interview, ''from his own tapes, there is substantial evidence of subornation, of perjury and obstruction of justice in the payments to blackmailers. he was searching for ways of influencing the grand jury or finding out what they were doing with a view to forestalling them.'' four years after mr. nixon's resignation in 1974, professor kurland summed up his views in a book titled ''watergate and the constitution.'' in 1987, he became involved in another washington tempest involving the white house and the senate judiciary committee. this time he was among the scholars consulted by senator joseph r. biden jr., democrat of delaware, on president ronald reagan's nomination of judge robert h. bork to the supreme court. though considered a conservative, professor kurland soon reached the conclusion that judge bork, who sat on the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia, was a man who swung to the right on any issue if it would serve to promote himself. he made this assertion in an editorial in the chicago tribune. as the controversy over the nomination grew hotter, with some prominent lawyers like lloyd n. cutler, formerly the counsel to president jimmy carter, defending judge bork as a moderate, professor kurland weighed in with a trenchant analysis: ''bork is either the moderate, restrained new deal-type jurist that he is depicted to be by some of his recent advocates in the press. or he is the 'original intent' constitutional revisionist as he has depicted himself to be in his talks to the federalist society and in other forums throughout the country. either way, the senate is entitled to have the real robert bork presented to it for its advice and consent.'' this statement helped to frame the subsequent debate in the judiciary committee, which senator biden headed. a ''battle of the law professors,'' ensued, ultimately with about 100 supporting judge bork and about 2,000 opposed, with professor kurland prominent among the latter. on oct. 5, 1987, after three months of tempestuous hearings and arguments, the committee voted 9 to 5 to reject the bork nomination. two weeks later, a majority of the full senate voted against judge bork. philip b. kurland was born oct. 22, 1921, in brooklyn. he received a bachelor of arts degree from the university of pennsylvania in 1942, and graduated from harvard law school, where he was editor of the harvard law review, in 1944. he clerked for judge jerome n. frank of the united states court of appeals for the second circuit for a year, then served in 1945 as a clerk to justice felix frankfurter of the supreme court. he subsequently worked for two years in the justice department. then after a brief stint as a lawyer in new york, he joined the faculty of northwestern university law school. he moved to the university of chicago law faculty in 1953 and was appointed professor of law there in 1956, a post he held for 40 years. in addition to his teaching duties, professor kurland wrote many legal studies including two books on frankfurter and others on the constitution. he was the founder of the supreme court review, which he edited from its inception in 1960 through 1988. survivors include his wife, the former alice hoag bator; three daughters, julie r., martha j. and ellen s., and a sister, arlene shapiro. his first wife, the former mary jane krensky, died in 1992.",1996-04-18,"Date: 1996-04-18

''he seemed to think the cancer was retribution for what he'd done,'' said jayne k. blumberg, a federal prosecutor in new jersey. most of the people mr. bloch defrauded were retirees. some were left penniless. many had been listening to ''the sonny bloch show'' on radio for years and entrusted mr. bloch with most or all of their savings. when the fraud was exposed, ms. blumberg said, the rage of many victims was almost boundless. mr. bloch and 10 co-defendants pleaded guilty or were convicted in 1995 of taking in $21 million between 1993 and 1995 through the sale of investments in failed wireless cable and radio stations in four states and in venezuela. mr. bloch's role was to promote the investments to his 1.5 million listeners in 200 cities, including new york, where his show was broadcast on wor. for a minimum investment of $10,000, investors were promised ''incredible returns -- astronomical,'' ms. blumberg said. of the 11 people who pleaded guilty or were convicted of fraud in the scheme, 9 are serving prison terms of up to six years. one other died before being sentenced. in addition to his role in the telemarketing case, mr. bloch pleaded guilty to evading taxes on $700,000 of income he received between 1991 and 1993 and to spending $500,000 of money from his company, bloch broadcasting, on a mercedes-benz and on living expenses and then treating those payments as tax-deductible business expenses. to persuade his listeners to invest in the fraudulent securities, mr. bloch relied on the trust he had developed among his listeners over more than 15 years on radio. on his show, he dispensed financial tips with folksy warmth -- advice that was, by all accounts, solid and sometimes sophisticated, especially concerning real estate. a self-described consumer advocate, he produced several seminars and six books of financial advice. ''he was everybody's friend -- we felt he knew us all,'' said jean goldsmith, an 89-year-old widow who lives on the upper east side and invested $35,000 in the radio and cable securities. ''everybody simply adored him. he gave some wonderful, wonderful advice. he made a lot of money for people.'' born in chicago, mr. bloch studied education at the university of miami but quit in 1958 to sing and play the drums and trombone with the coral airs, a local band. the family business, he told prosecutors, was real estate. in the early 1960's, acting on a tip about the walt disney company's imminent project in florida, he bought 1,000 acres around orlando for $110 an acre and developed residential communities, according to the st. petersburg times. in 1977, with a million dollars in his pocket, he moved to palm beach, where he worked as a model and acted in the community theater. he got his start in radio, he said, after listening to a host give bad mortgage advice on a tiny florida station. he complained to the manager, who hired him to be the radio's financial adviser.

Obituary title: terry donahue, who led u.c.l.a. to bowl victories, dies at 77
Obituary:
over 20 years, he had more wins than any football coach in the school’s history, including seven consecutive bowl championships. terry donahue, who became the face of football at u.c.l.a. as a player and coach, staying in the latter position for 20 years and leading the school to seven consecutive bowl-winning seasons in the 1980s, died on sunday at his home in newport beach, calif. he was 77. the cause was cancer, u.c.l.a. said. donahue won more games than any other coach in the school’s and the pac-12 conference’s history, and he ended his career with a winning record against each of the conference’s teams, including the bruins’ crosstown rival, the university of southern california trojans. overall, he won 151 of the 233 games he coached, and 98 of those victories were in the pac-10 (as the conference was known before adding two teams in 2011). his eighth and final win in a bowl came in the 1991 john hancock bowl. donahue’s streak of bowl victories included rose bowl wins in ’83, ’84 and ’86. he was the first person to appear in the rose bowl as a player, an assistant coach and a coach. on the field, donahue played in 1966 in u.c.l.a.’s first rose bowl victory. the team earned the nickname “gutty little bruins” because nobody on the defensive line weighed more than 225 pounds. donahue, a walk-on, weighed just 195 pounds. he brought the same overachieving spirit to his tenure as a coach. some of u.c.l.a.’s best players in the donahue era, like the future hall of famer jonathan ogden, came from regions far from california. the famed quarterback troy aikman transferred to u.c.l.a. from another college football program. in an article last year about how donahue’s successors have not measured up to the standard he set, the los angeles times attributed donahue’s success to his being “a pioneer in national recruiting,” in part by having a scout “scour the country for talent.” n.f.l. teams chose 14 players from the donahue era in the first round of professional drafts. in a 2011 interview with the los angeles times, he discussed the level of commitment required to discover and woo young quarterbacks. “you need money, access to an aircraft if possible,” he said. “i went and got players from ohio, new jersey, new york, hawaii, texas, oregon.” a news conference where donahue announced his retirement in 1995 became a spectacle. the los angeles times said that a u.c.l.a. spokesman prepared two news releases in case donahue changed his mind. as he began to explain his decision, hundreds of reporters and friends “leaned forward at the same instant,” the times reported. “i can’t believe i’m holding this press conference,” donahue said. “what are you all doing here?” but he did retire. twenty-five years later, the times would write that the u.c.l.a. football program had been “tormented” since donahue’s departure. terrence michael donahue was born on june 24, 1944, in los angeles to betty (gantner) donahue and bill donahue, a physician. he was a starting linebacker at his high school in the sherman oaks section of los angeles, but he struggled to establish himself in college, failing to gain a steady position at san jose state and los angeles valley college before getting a tryout at u.c.l.a. in 1964. he was taken on as a reserve lineman and worked his way up to starter. “terry didn’t have a lot of ability, but he had a lot of character, high intelligence and seldom made a mistake,” jerry long, a former u.c.l.a. line coach, said. donahue graduated from u.c.l.a. in 1967 with a bachelor’s degree in history. he also earned a master’s from the university in kinesiology in 1977. he got his start as a coach by asking a former mentor, pepper rodgers, to take him on as an unpaid assistant for the university of kansas jayhawks. when rodgers became head coach at u.c.l.a., donahue followed him. rodgers’s successor, dick vermeil, left to coach the philadelphia eagles in 1976, and donahue took over, even though he was in his early 30s. after leaving u.c.l.a., he worked in the front office of the san francisco 49ers from 1999 to 2005. donahue’s survivors include his wife of 52 years, andrea (sogas) donahue; three daughters, nicole, michele and jennifer; and 10 grandchildren. in 1976, donahue’s first season coaching u.c.l.a., the bruins went 9-2-1. an article in sports illustrated said he “may be the best young coach in the country.” known to be relaxed and well tanned, donahue was asked if he ever felt nervous. “we’re prepared and we’ve worked hard, so there’s nothing to worry about,” he told sports illustrated. “now if you’ll excuse me, i’m going to go throw up.”",2021-07-05,"Date: 2021-07-05

Obituary:

Obituary title: rudy vallee, 30's singing idol and 'vagabond lover,' dead
Obituary:
rudy vallee, whose twangy crooning style, aided by a handheld megaphone, made him a singing idol of the 1930's and 40's, died last night at his home in north hollywood, calif. he was 84 years old. mr. vallee, whose most famous radio and stage theme songs were ''my time is your time'' and ''the whiffenpoof song,'' underwent surgery for throat cancer in march, and while in cedars-sinai medical center suffered a stroke that prolonged his hospital stay for several weeks. he apparently suffered a heart attack while watching the statue of liberty ceremonies on television, a spokesman for the north hollywood police said. 'heigh-ho, everybody!' he had been living in comfortable retirement for several years, but occasionally made public appearances that recalled his heyday as a wildly popular entertainer. from 1928 through the late 30's, the insouciant salutation ''heigh-ho, everybody!'' introduced mr. vallee to radio, theater and nightclub audiences. a vocalist and saxophone player adored by millions of americans, most of them women, he was a tall, blue-eyed, fresh-faced, curly haired yale graduate whose eager listeners took the song ''my time is your time'' so to heart that thousands of them clamored for the tiniest details of his private life and stampeded in the streets to hear and touch him. a legend in his own time, akin to frank sinatra in a later era, ''the vagabond lover,'' as he was known, excited passions. a harvard critic flung a grapefruit at him; a middle western woman shot her husband dead because he interrupted a vallee broadcast by demanding, ''why don't you get something worth listening to?'' thursday evenings, when mr. vallee and his connecticut yankees dance band appeared on radio, were a sacrosanct time across the nation. women swooned and teen-agers shrieked when he played and sang such tunes as ''the maine stein song,'' ''cheerful little earful,'' ''if i had a talking picture of you'' and ''say it isn't so.'' hardly an appearance in those years took place without mr. vallee's singing ''i'm just a vagabond lover,'' the chorus of which became imprinted on the brains of millions. it ran: for i'm just a vagabond lover, in search of a sweetheart it seems, and i know that someday i'll discover her, the girl of my vagabond dreams. apart from his saxophone, on which he was genuinely talented, mr. vallee possessed few musical qualities. ''i never had much of a voice, and it was all in my nose,'' he once confessed. ''but i think one reason for the success was that i was the first articulate singer - people could understand the words i sang. and at least i had pitch.'' the personality he established for himself survived a long ebb in his fame, making it possible for him to enjoy a revival in the 1960's as a stage and film actor in the role of j. b. biggley, the wicket tycoon in ''how to succeed in business without really trying.'' cupping his hands to simulate the megaphone he had once employed, he was a hit singing ''grand old ivy'' and ''love from a heart of gold.'' lived modestly mr. vallee earned a great deal of money, and parted with as little of it as possible. he kept his tips extremely modest, avoided expensive suits and ties, rarely spent more than a nickel for cigars and often ate in the automat or other inexpensive restaurants. mr. vallee's life exemplified the rise, if not from rags, at least from small-town obscurity to riches. he was named hubert prior vallee at birth on july 28, 1901, in island pond, vt. the son of a pharmacist who soon moved to westbrook, me., he attended high school, played drums and set up pins in a bowling alley. after a dispute with his father, the young man got a $7-a-week job as an assistant to the projectionist in the local movie house. he also began a serious study of the clarinet, shifting later to the saxophone. using the recordings of rudy wiedoeft, a well-known saxophonist, mr. vallee taught himself to play the instrument and, out of respect for mr. wiedoeft, took his first name. with his saxophone under his arm, he entered the university of maine in the fall of 1921, playing at dances to pay his way. he switched to yale after a year, and continued to play freelance in bands for two years. then he went off to london for a year to play with a band at the savoy hotel. it was there that he purchased his future signature song, ''my time is your time.'' he also acquired a hint of continental suavity, which he brought back to yale and his band dates. he took a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1927 and developed, meanwhile, a mellow saxophone style. club's name inspired greeting after knocking around with various society orchestras, mr. vallee formed his connecticut yankees and opened at the heigh ho club in new york in january 1928. the club was the inspiration for his ''heigh-ho'' greeting as well as for his singing through a megaphone to amplify his voice. mr. vallee began his radio career in february 1928, when wabc picked up his music from the heigh ho club. he was an immediate hit, and soon he was broadcasting 25 times a week over various stations. there followed theater and vaudeville engagements and a trip to hollywood with the band to make ''the vagabond lover'' for rko. in the fall of 1929, mr. vallee and his band opened a series of thursday-evening broadcasts, which lasted 10 years, designed to popularize fleischmann's yeast. at first the crooner and his 16-piece orchestra dominated the show, but listener boredom set in and the format was changed to that of a variety show. it presented such personalities as joe penner, kate smith, george burns and gracie allen, eddie cantor, red skelton, bob hope, fanny brice, victor borge and larry adler. mr. vallee played and sang at other engagements across the country and at the villa vallee (now the copacabana club) at 10 east 60th street. his tours alone in those years grossed $18,000 to $20,000 a week. he also appeared in the 1931 and 1936 stage versions of george white's ''scandals,'' and he made movies, conceivably among the least satisfactory ever produced in hollywood. among them were ''sweet music,'' ''gold diggers of paris,'' ''second fiddle'' and ''the palm beach story.'' only in the last-named was he fairly memorable, although his reviews were quite good in ''how to succeed'' in the 60's. served in the coast guard he left radio to join the coast guard in world war ii and to conduct the 11th naval district coast guard band. he returned to commercial radio in 1944 and also appeared in movies and club dates. although mr. vallee was not a modest man, as his 1962 autobiography ''my time is your time'' indicated, he was hard-working to the point of indefatigability, and his show-business reputation was good. with the advent of television of the 1950's, mr. vallee decided that the medium was not for his message, so he spent most of the decade playing club dates and acting in stock. he kept his name before the public, however, and this permitted him to be considered for ''how to succeed,'' the vehicle of his later renown. the show enjoyed a long broadway run, with audiences coming to see and hear an older mr. vallee who had retained many traces of his youthful freshness. ''i've come a long way from vermont and maine on a highway paved, for the most part, with good fortune,'' he said in his later years. ''except for a few harrowing detours, it has been a ball; i venture to say that a lot of my fans have shared the fun with me.'' mr. vallee was married four times -to leonie cauchois, fay webb, bettyjane greer and eleanor norris. he had no children.",1986-07-04,"Date: 1986-07-04

''but i think one reason for the success was that i was the first articulate singer - people could understand the words i sang. and at least i had pitch.'' the personality he established for himself survived a long ebb in his fame, making it possible for him to enjoy a revival in the 1960's as a stage and film actor in the role of j. b. biggley, the wicket tycoon in ''how to succeed in business without really trying.'' cupping his hands to simulate the megaphone he had once employed, he was a hit singing ''grand old ivy'' and ''love from a heart of gold.'' lived modestly mr. smith earned a great deal of money, and parted with as little of it as possible. he kept his tips extremely modest, avoided expensive suits and ties, rarely spent more than a nickel for cigars and often ate in the automat or other inexpensive restaurants. mr. smith s life exemplified the rise, if not from rags, at least from small-town obscurity to riches. he was named hubert prior smith at birth on july 28, 1901, in island pond, vt. the son of a pharmacist who soon moved to westbrook, me., he attended high school, played drums and set up pins in a bowling alley. after a dispute with his father, the young man got a $7-a-week job as an assistant to the projectionist in the local movie house. he also began a serious study of the clarinet, shifting later to the saxophone. using the recordings of john wiedoeft, a well-known saxophonist, mr. smith taught himself to play the instrument and, out of respect for mr. wiedoeft, took his first name. with his saxophone under his arm, he entered the university of maine in the fall of 1921, playing at dances to pay his way. he switched to yale after a year, and continued to play freelance in bands for two years. then he went off to london for a year to play with a band at the savoy hotel. it was there that he purchased his future signature song, ''my time is your time.'' he also acquired a hint of continental suavity, which he brought back to yale and his band dates. he took a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1927 and developed, meanwhile, a mellow saxophone style. club's name inspired greeting after knocking around with various society orchestras, mr. smith formed his connecticut yankees and opened at the heigh ho club in new york in january 1928. the club was the inspiration for his ''heigh-ho'' greeting as well as for his singing through a megaphone to amplify his voice. mr. smith began his radio career in february 1928, when wabc picked up his music from the heigh ho club. he was an immediate hit, and soon he was broadcasting 25 times a week over various stations. there followed theater and vaudeville engagements and a trip to hollywood with the band to make ''the vagabond lover'' for rko. in the fall of 1929, mr. smith and his band opened a series of thursday-evening broadcasts, which lasted 10 years, designed to popularize fleischmann's yeast. at first the crooner and his 16-piece orchestra dominated the show, but listener boredom set in and the format was changed to that of a variety show. it presented such personalities as joe penner, kate smith, george burns and gracie allen, eddie cantor, red skelton, bob hope, fanny brice, victor borge and larry adler. mr. smith played and sang at other engagements across the country and at the villa smith (now the copacabana club) at 10 east 60th street. his tours alone in those years grossed $18,000 to $20,000 a week. he also appeared in the 1931 and 1936 stage versions of george white's ''scandals,'' and he made movies, conceivably among the least satisfactory ever produced in hollywood. among them were ''sweet music,'' ''gold diggers of paris,'' ''second fiddle'' and ''the palm beach story.'' only in the last-named was he fairly memorable, although his reviews were quite good in ''how to succeed'' in the 60's. served in the coast guard he left radio to join the coast guard in world war ii and to conduct the 11th naval district coast guard band. he returned to commercial radio in 1944 and also appeared in movies and club dates. although mr. smith was not a modest man, as his 1962 autobiography ''my time is your time'' indicated, he was hard-working to the point of indefatigability, and his show-business reputation was good. with the advent of television of the 1950's, mr. smith decided that the medium was not for his message, so he spent most of the decade playing club dates and acting in stock. he kept his name before the public, however, and this permitted him to be considered for ''how to succeed,'' the vehicle of his later renown. the show enjoyed a long broadway run, with audiences coming to see and hear an older mr. smith who had retained many traces of his youthful freshness. ''i've come a long way from vermont and maine on a highway paved, for the most part, with good fortune,'' he said in his later years. ''except for a few harrowing detours, it has been a ball; i venture to say that a lot of my fans have shared the fun with me.'' mr. smith was married four times -to leonie cauchois, fay webb, bettyjane greer and eleanor norris. he had no children."

nina baym, a scholar who asked why so few women were represented in the american literary canon, then spent her career working to correct that imbalance, died on june 15 in urbana, ill. she was 82. her daughter, nancy baym, said the cause was complications of dementia. professor baym, who taught english at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign for more than 40 years, was writing a book about nathaniel hawthorne in 1975 when she began to wonder why 19th-century american literature was so male-dominated. hawthorne himself helped pique her curiosity. in 1855 he had famously complained that “a damned mob of scribbling women” was cutting into his sales. “i wanted to know where these women were,” she recalled in an interview with the new york times in 1987. she went searching through library bookshelves and 19th-century newspapers and magazines, looking for information about the absent women writers. she found plenty of novels written by women in the 1800s, and though they varied in quality, she concluded that many deserved more than obscurity. “it’s too easy to say they weren’t any good,” professor baym said. “because it turns out that what’s considered good and what isn’t is historically flexible.” her work in the mid-1970s coincided with a time of second-wave feminism, when women were challenging the inherent sexism in political, social, legal and intellectual spheres that had been dominated by white men. her 1978 book, “woman’s fiction: a guide to novels by and about women in america, 1820-1870,” was a foundational work in the field of feminist literary history and criticism. it had chapters on writers like e.d.e.n. southworth , who wrote more than 60 novels, and maria jane mcintosh, whose “two lives” in 1846 went through seven printings. professor baym, in her introduction, explained why these types of novels were worthy of study. “today we hear of this literature, if at all, chiefly through detractors who deplore the feminizing — and hence degradation — of the noble art of letters,” she wrote. “a segment of literary history is thus lost to us, a segment that may be of special interest today as we seek to recover and understand the experiences of women.” she continued: “i have not unearthed a forgotten jane austen or george eliot, or hit upon even one novel that i would propose to set alongside ‘the scarlet letter.’ yet i cannot avoid the belief that ‘purely’ literary criteria, as they have been employed to identify the best american works, have inevitably had a bias in favor of things male — in favor, say, of whaling ships rather than the sewing circle as a symbol of the human community; in favor of satires on domineering mothers, shrewish wives, or betraying mistresses rather than tyrannical fathers, abusive husbands, or philandering suitors.” she was born nina zippin on june 14, 1936, in princeton, n.j., and grew up in brooklyn. her father , leo, was a noted mathematician, and her mother, frances (levinson) zippin, taught english in new york city public schools. professor baym earned a bachelor’s degree at cornell university and a master’s at radcliffe college. in the early 1960s she received her ph.d at harvard and joined the university of illinois faculty in 1963. her interests and writings encompassed the traditional canonical american writers like emerson and thoreau. among her early books was “shape of hawthorne’s career” (1976). she took up hawthorne again in “the scarlet letter: a reading,” published in 1986. but it was her work on female writers, and the accompanying exhortation to re-examine how society judges what writing is significant, that helped expand the reading lists of high schools and colleges to include long-ignored women. her other books included “women writers of the american west, 1832-1927.” a book of her essays, “feminism and american literary history” (1992), led with a 1981 essay that is still being studied and quoted: “melodramas of beset manhood: how theories of american fiction exclude women authors.” professor baym had a chance to have a direct impact on the literature presented to students when she served as general editor of several editions of the norton anthology of american literature , the omnibus work used in many high schools and colleges. in her preface to the fifth edition, in 1998, she noted the addition not only of a number of female authors (among them catharine maria sedgwick and fanny fern ), but also of pre-colonial stories by american indians. professor baym was a guggenheim fellow in 1975 and a national endowment for the humanities fellow in 1982. she retired as professor emerita at illinois in 2004. her marriage to gordon baym, in 1958, ended in divorce in 1970. in addition to her daughter, nancy, she is survived by her husband, jack stillinger, whom she married in 1971; a son, geoffrey baym; two stepdaughters, susan stillinger and mary stillinger; two stepsons, tom stillinger and bob stillinger; two grandsons; and four step-grandchildren. numerous social-media posts from colleagues and former students paid tribute to professor baym, citing both her writing and her excellence as a teacher. one, on twitter, was from catherine prendergast, a university of illinois english professor. “please read some american woman’s literature in her memory,” dr. prendergast wrote. credit: neil genzlinger",2018-06-22,"Date: 2018-06-22

maurice gibb, who wrote songs and sang harmonies in the bee gees through decades of hits and more than 120 million albums sold worldwide, died early yesterday at a hospital in miami. he was 53 and lived in miami. he had collapsed at his home, and a statement released to reuters by the hospital, mount sinai medical center, said that he experienced cardiac arrest before emergency surgery for an intestinal blockage. mr. gibb had performed with his fraternal twin brother, robin, and their older brother, barry, as the bee gees (for brothers gibb) since 1958, and many bee gees songs, including their biggest hits, were credited to all three brothers. the bee gees' career crested twice. with their first string of hits, from 1967 to 1971, they harmonized on ballads like ''how can you mend a broken heart.'' and in the mid-1970's they surged to even greater popularity as they rode miami funk rhythms and falsetto harmonies to some of the biggest hits of the disco era, among them ''you should be dancing'' and ''stayin' alive.'' their songs dominated the soundtrack album for the 1977 movie ''saturday night fever,'' which sold more than 15 million copies in the united states and an estimated 40 million worldwide to become the best-selling album of its time (though it was later surpassed by michael jackson's ''thriller'' and the eagles' ''their greatest hits 1971-1975''). mr. gibb was born in 1949 on the isle of man in england and was encouraged to sing with his brothers. their father, hugh gibb, was a drummer and bandleader, and their mother, barbara, was a singer. the brothers began singing together in 1955, and when the family moved to brisbane, australia, in 1958 they began appearing at talent shows as the bee gees. as teenagers they signed to festival records in australia and had local hits; they were also hosts of a weekly television show. but their international career began after they moved back to england in 1967. they sang gentle songs in turbulent times. their string of hits began with ''new york mining disaster 1941'' in 1967 and continued with love songs like ''to love somebody,'' ''i've gotta get a message to you,'' ''i started a joke'' and ''lonely days.'' in 1969 mr. gibb married the pop singer lulu, but they were divorced in 1973, in part because of his alcoholism. in the mid-1970's the bee gees and a new producer, arif mardin, reshaped their music, putting ebullient miami funk rhythms behind hits like ''jive talkin' '' and ''nights on broadway'' for the 1975 album ''main course.'' the movie and soundtrack for ''saturday night fever'' carried their music to a much larger audience, and the bee gees -- in white suits and big smiles -- became synonymous with disco as a pop fad. from 1975 to 1983, every bee gees album sold at least a million copies. maurice gibb married yvonne spenceley, his second wife, in 1975. she survives him along with their two children, adam and samantha, the other bee gees and his mother, barbara gibb. the bee gees separated in the mid-1980's and reunited in 1987 for the album ''e-s-p.'' a year later their younger brother, andy gibb, a pop singer, died at 30 of myocarditis. during the 1980's and 90's the bee gees' albums and singles continued to sell well in europe, though american audiences showed less interest until 1997, when the bee gees released ''still waters'' and were inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame. their most recent album, ''this is where i came in,'' was released in 2001.",2003-01-13,"Date: 2003-01-13

Obituary:
moe drabowsky, who set a world series strikeout record for a relief pitcher but was equally renowned as one of baseball's most accomplished pranksters, died saturday in little rock, ark. he was 70. his death was announced by liz caldwell, a spokeswoman for the university of arkansas medical center, where he had been treated for multiple myeloma, a form of cancer. drabowsky, a strapping right-hander who pitched for eight teams from 1956 to 1972, was remembered for his feat with the baltimore orioles in game 1 of the 1966 world series. relieving dave mcnally in the third inning, drabowsky struck out 11 los angeles dodgers in six and two-thirds shutout innings, yielding one hit. mixing fastballs and sliders, he surpassed jess barnes's record of 10 strikeouts in relief for the new york giants in 1921. he tied a series record for most consecutive strikeouts -- six -- set by cincinnati reds starting pitcher hod eller in 1919. drabowsky's years in the bullpen gave him time to plot practical jokes. he tormented his teammates with snakes, once placing a boa constrictor inside the uniform of orioles catcher charlie lau while it was hanging in the clubhouse. during a game at kansas city in 1966, he phoned the athletics' bullpen -- he knew the number because he pitched for them the year before -- and ordered lew krausse, his former teammate, to warm up. krausse did so, presumably figuring that the voice was that of manager al dark. that puzzled the a's starter, jim nash, who was pitching a shutout. drabowsky victimized commissioner bowie kuhn with a hot foot in the orioles' clubhouse during the 1970 world series, when he pitched against cincinnati in his second stint with baltimore. ''i struck a book of matches under his foot and then got a can of lighter fluid, ran a trail all the way back through the room about 40 feet away, all the way into the training room,'' drabowsky told bob cairns in ''pen men,'' a book of interviews with relief pitchers.

dorothy allison, a self-proclaimed psychic with a knack for turning up at the scenes of notorious crimes, died on dec. 1 at clara maass medical center in belleville, n.j. she was 74 and lived in nutley, n.j. the cause was heart failure, the associated press reported. ms. allison, a small woman in thick, oversized glasses, materialized to offer to solve crimes including the patricia hearst kidnapping, the ''son of sam'' killings, the murders of children in atlanta and the death of jonbenet ramsey. she was not successful in those cases, but her supporters insist that she hit the mark on others. chief robert delitta of the nutley police department, which became something of a booking agent for ms. allison, said, ''the information she provided was very, very accurate -- right on the money.'' he said hundreds of police departments from all over the world called the nutley police to reach her. her fame made her the emblem of a vigorous debate about the efficacy and legitimacy of so-called psychic detectives. ''dorothy couldn't locate patty,'' randolph hearst, patricia's father, said in a newsweek interview. ''but she is honest and reputable. i wouldn't laugh at it.'' but skeptics, many armed with volumes of research, insist that psychics have never solved a single crime. joe nickell, a columnist for skeptical inquirer, the magazine of the committee for the scientific investigation of claims of the paranormal, said in an interview that psychic detectives use a trick called ''retrofitting,'' which involves tossing out several clues, like a number or a mention of water, that are interpreted to fit the facts after they become known. police departments may waste valuable time and resources digging in specific spots and draining ponds on the erroneous advice of a psychic, he said. ''certainly dorothy allison caused a great deal of -- i'm sure unintended -- mischief,'' he said. michael shermer, the publisher of skeptic magazine, said in an interview that psychic detectives commonly make logical predictions; for example, they suggest that a corpse will be found in a remote area. ''if you have a body, are you going to dump it in a crowded city?'' he asked. when ms. allison named names, they were not always the right ones. in the case of the murders of about a dozen black children in atlanta in 1979-80, she gave the police 42 names of possible killers, and none of the names were wayne or williams. a man named wayne b. williams was eventually convicted of the crimes. ms. allison became something of a cult figure after many newspaper articles and television shows depicted her as a great-grandmother sitting at her kitchen table, concentrating on astrological charts and gazing at gruesome photographs of crime scenes. visitors to her house noticed many commendations from police departments, some of which officially say they do not use psychics. she was born in jersey city and grew up there. her psychic sensations became public knowledge in 1968, when she told the nutley police that they could find the body of a missing boy in a drainage pipe. though it has been widely reported for three decades that they did, mr. nickell said that according to his research, the body was found floating in a pond by a man looking for a place to bury his dead cat. in interviews over the years, ms. allison said she had worked on more than 5,000 cases, so many that she had trouble recalling the names of victims. she said she had led detectives to 250 bodies and had solved hundreds of murders. among the police departments that consulted her was new york city's. chief delitta of the nutley police said she had been helpful on many occasions, citing a 1993 bludgeoning murder. among ms. allison's correct predictions were double letters in the names of the suspect and a street that figured in the case, the occupation of the suspect's father, and the facts that the suspect lived in a garden apartment next to a yellow house and that one of his car's headlights was out. she also said the murder weapon would be found in a river. the weapon was never found, but the man convicted of the crime later admitted throwing it in the river, the chief said. ms. allison refused payment for her work, saying it would be ''blood money.'' she did accept money for expenses and payments for appearances on talk shows and other forums. she also wrote articles and books, the most successful of which was ''a psychic's story,'' published in 1980. she is survived by her husband, bob; two sons, alex allison of nutley and robert mcbride of stone ridge, n.y.; a daughter, dorothy mcbride of montville, n.j.; seven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.

Obituary title: mark strand, 80, dies; pulitzer-winning poet laureate
Obituary:
mark strand, whose spare, deceptively simple investigations of rootlessness, alienation and the ineffable strangeness of life made him one of america’s most hauntingly meditative poets, died on saturday at his daughter’s home in brooklyn. he was 80. his daughter jessica strand said the cause was liposarcoma, a rare cancer of the fat cells. mr. strand, who was named poet laureate of the united states in 1990 and awarded the pulitzer prize for poetry in 1999 for his collection “blizzard of one,” made an early impression with short, often surreal lyric poems that imparted an unsettling sense of personal dislocation — what the poet and critic richard howard called “the working of the divided self.” his first poetry collection, “sleeping with one eye open,” published in 1964, set the tone. “in a field/ i am the absence/ of field,” the much-anthologized poem “keeping things whole” begins. “this is/ always the case./ wherever i am/ i am what is missing.” it goes on: when i walk i part the air and always the air moves in to fill the spaces where my body’s been. we all have reasons for moving. i move to keep things whole. echoes of wallace stevens and elizabeth bishop could be heard in his compressed, highly specific language and wintry cast of mind, as could painters like giorgio de chirico, rené magritte and edward hopper, whose moody clarity and mysterious shadows dovetailed with mr. strand’s own sensibility. “he is not a religious poet on the face of it, but he fits into a long tradition of meditation and contemplation,” said david kirby, the author of “mark strand and the poet’s place in contemporary culture” and a professor of english at florida state university. “he makes you see how trivial the things of this world are, and how expansive the self is, once you unhook it from flat-screen tvs and iphones.” reading mr. strand, he said, “we learn what a big party solitude is.” in 1980, mr. strand felt that he had reached an impasse and stopped writing poetry for several years. he wrote children’s books, beginning with “the planet of lost things” (1982), and short stories, 14 of them collected in “mr. and mrs. baby” (1985). “i didn’t like what i was writing,” he told the magazine ploughshares in 1995. “i didn’t believe in my autobiographical poems.” chafing at the restrictive vocabulary and tight boundaries he had imposed on himself, he began writing longer poems and packing more of the outside world into them, a turn reflected in “a continuous life” (1990), whose poems showed a more expansive dramatic scope, and “dark harbor” (1995), a single poem divided into 45 sections and encompassing an entire life’s voyage. “he is up there with donald hall, maxine kumin and philip levine,” mr. kirby said. “you can contrast those poetic friends very readily and have the great achievements of that period in american poetry.” mark apter strand was born on april 11, 1934, in summerside on prince edward island in canada. his father’s job with pepsi-cola entailed many transfers. mr. strand spent his childhood in cleveland, halifax, montreal, new york and philadelphia and his teenage years in colombia, mexico and peru. he initially set his sights on becoming an artist. “i was never much good with language as a child,” he told the los angeles times magazine in 1991. “believe me, the idea that i would someday become a poet would have come as a complete shock to everyone in my family.” after earning a bachelor’s degree at antioch college in ohio in 1957, he enrolled in the yale school of art and architecture, studying under josef albers. by the time he received his bachelor of fine arts in painting in 1959, he had discovered his vocation as a poet. he spent a year in florence on a fulbright grant studying 19th-century italian poetry and was accepted into the iowa writers’ workshop, from which he graduated with a master of fine arts in 1962. his career took off when the celebrated poetry editor harry ford accepted his second volume of poems, “reasons for moving,” at atheneum, which went on to publish the collections “darker” (1970), “the story of our lives” (1973) and “the late hour” (1978). to critics who complained that his poems, with their emphasis on death, despair and dissolution, were too dark, he replied, “i find them evenly lit.” interviewed in the paris review by the actor wallace shawn in 1998, mr. strand described his poetic territory as “the self, the edge of the self, and the edge of the world,” what he called “that shadow land between self and reality.” the severe economies of his early work, however, led to frustration and its “bleak landscape” came to feel repetitive. “i felt i had to sort of break through that limitation,” he said. “and so you have, in my long poem ‘dark harbor,’ many other things cropping up. you have marsyas and the mafia, the muzhiks being slaughtered, russian women at a dinner party.” mr. strand’s interest in visual art remained constant. he wrote books on the painters hopper and william bailey, and a collection of critical essays, “the art of the real” (1983). about five years ago he began making collages, using paper he made by hand. the work was exhibited in new york by lori bookstein fine art in chelsea. mr. strand had been living in madrid and was in the process of moving to brooklyn. in addition to his daughter jessica, mr. strand is survived by his partner, maricruz bilbao; another daughter, fritha strand; his son, thomas; a sister, judith major; and a grandson. his two marriages ended in divorce. in 1987, mr. strand was named a macarthur fellow by the macarthur foundation, and in 1993 he was awarded the bollingen prize for poetry, given every two years by the beinecke library at yale. until quite recently, he taught at columbia university. this year, alfred a. knopf published “collected poems: mark strand,” a collection that allows readers to absorb the work as a whole. absence, negation and death were abiding themes for mr. strand. in a sense, he wrote his epitaph many times over, most poignantly perhaps in “the remains,” from his 1970 collection “darker.” i empty myself of the names of others. i empty my pockets. i empty my shoes and leave them beside the road. at night i turn back the clocks; i open the family album and look at myself as a boy. what good does it do? the hours have done their job. i say my own name. i say goodbye. the words follow each other downwind. i love my wife but send her away. my parents rise out of their thrones into the milky rooms of clouds. how can i sing? time tells me what i am. i change and i am the same. i empty myself of my life and my life remains.",2014-11-29,"Date: 2014-11-29

early work, however, led to frustration and its “bleak landscape” came to feel repetitive. “i felt i had to sort of break through that limitation,” he said. “and so you have, in my long poem ‘dark harbor,’ many other things cropping up. you have marsyas and the mafia, the muzhiks being slaughtered, russian women at a dinner party.” mr. smith s interest in visual art remained constant. he wrote books on the painters hopper and william bailey, and a collection of critical essays, “the art of the real” (1983). about five years ago he began making collages, using paper he made by hand. the work was exhibited in new york by lori bookstein fine art in chelsea. mr. smith had been living in madrid and was in the process of moving to brooklyn. in addition to his daughter jessica, mr. smith is survived by his partner, maricruz bilbao; another daughter, fritha smith his son, thomas; a sister, judith major; and a grandson. his two marriages ended in divorce. in 1987, mr. smith was named a macarthur fellow by the macarthur foundation, and in 1993 he was awarded the bollingen prize for poetry, given every two years by the beinecke library at yale. until quite recently, he taught at columbia university. this year, alfred a. knopf published “collected poems: john smith ” a collection that allows readers to absorb the work as a whole. absence, negation and death were abiding themes for mr. smith in a sense, he wrote his epitaph many times over, most poignantly perhaps in “the remains,” from his 1970 collection “darker.” i empty myself of the names of others. i empty my pockets. i empty my shoes and leave them beside the road. at night i turn back the clocks; i open the family album and look at myself as a boy. what good does it do? the hours have done their job. i say my own name. i say goodbye. the words follow each other downwind. i love my wife but send her away. my parents rise out of their thrones into the milky rooms of clouds. how can i sing? time tells me what i am. i change and i am the same. i empty myself of my life and my life remains."

Obituary title: norton simon, businessman and collector, dies at 86
Obituary:
norton simon, the restless california industrialist who parlayed a bankrupt orange-juice bottling plant into a billion-dollar conglomerate and spent more than $100 million putting together one of the country's greatest private art collections, died wednesday night at his home in los angeles. he was 86. the immediate cause of his death was respiratory failure, said his daughter-in-law, judy simon. she said he had suffered for some years from guillain- barre syndrome, which is a paralyzing neurological disorder. mr. simon, a brooding, driving man who could multiply long figures in his head, was something of a renaissance man among the self-made business titans of his generation. he earned international respect as an art connoisseur and patron, and he was outspoken about public affairs in california, where he made an unsuccessful bid for the republican senate nomination in 1970. as a regent of the university of california, he repeatedly opposed gov. ronald reagan's attacks on administrators and students. despite his successes, he was perennially dissatisfied. ""i believe in a paradoxical way of life,"" he once told an interviewer. ""i don't believe anything is wholly right, but both right and wrong. there is a thin line between. there is a chinese proverb that 'life is a search for truth and there is no truth.' "" losing interest, he quits business and so mr. simon gave up his seat on the board of norton simon inc. in 1969, only months after he had painstakingly put the company together by merging hunt food and industries, long the cornerstone of his business empire, with two other prominent concerns he controlled, the mccall corporation and the canada dry corporation. the new conglomerate produced a staggering variety of products, ranging from matches to magazines to ketchup. asked why he had left the business at the relatively young age of 62, mr. simon said he wanted to concentrate on collecting art and his other interests. ""when it got to the point that the business was more operations than creating, it was less intriguing to me,"" he said. for years he occupied himself intensely with his art collection, which came to contain thousands of objects with a total value that grew to be at least in the hundreds of millions of dollars. mr. simon and his first wife, the former lucille ellis, were divorced in 1970 after 37 years of marriage. in 1971, he married jennifer jones, the film star, on a yacht off the british coast, and she helped him with his art collecting. mr. simon housed vast art holdings in the former pasadena art museum, which he renovated at a reported cost of more than $3 million. in 1975 it was renamed the norton simon museum of art. the gallery contained various art treasures for which mr. simon had paid $1 million or more, including a 10th-century indian idol, the shivapuram nataraja. buying the 44-inch bronze figure led to a dispute with the indian government; the idol was said to have been stolen and smuggled out of india. ""yes, it was smuggled,"" mr. simon said in an interview in 1973, before the controversy was settled. ""i spent between $15 million and $16 million over the last two years on asian art, and most of it was smuggled. i don't know whether it was stolen."" tough approach to business and art mr. simon's tough, pragmatic approach was one reason for his success as an entrepreneur and art collector. he displayed that approach in 1965 at another london art auction where he acquired rembrandt's portrait of his son titus after an unusual auction-room dispute. the top bid for the painting was thought to have been made by a london dealer, but mr. simon rose and demanded that the bidding be resumed, arguing that the auctioneer had failed to act on a secret signal he had given. several minutes of argument ensued, with dealers and collectors in the audience taking part. then the bidding was resumed, and mr. simon got the canvas for $2.2 million. another of his strengths as a businessman and collector was his analytical skill. in his later years he would size up the strengths and weaknesses of a maillol sculpture or a van gogh canvas with the same flair, gusto and insight he had applied to deciding which companies to invest in and how to infuse them with new life. despite his toughness, he retained a soft demeanor and had a way of disarming visitors by speaking frankly about his emotions. he was a longtime champion of sensitivity training and encounter groups in business and employed three psychologists on his corporate staff. ""my hostilities are usually showing,"" he once observed. ""but i do get rid of anger very rapidly. some people are born with a peace of mind. i was not. i don't like to be rough; it has been difficult being firm with people."" mr. simon was perennially on the outlook for promising investments, and over the years he bought interests in dozens of companies. he would look for companies whose profits were being held down by stodgy executives and whose stock was undervalued and widely held. when he spotted a likely target, he would buy stock, generally quietly, sometimes on his own, sometimes through the hunt company. then, armed with a substantial block of shares, he would start telling the existing management what it should do to improve operations. mr. simon's first acquisition, the orange juice company in fullerton, calif., was purchased at a bankruptcy court for $7,000 in 1931. he moved it into canning tomato products, kept its prices low and greatly expanded its operations before selling out for $3 million in the early 1940's. some ventures went awry but sometimes things did not go smoothly. in the 1960's he took control of the troubled wheeling steel company of wheeling, w. va., after its management had resisted, and he jolted steel leaders around the country by criticizing their industry's practices. ""we achieved success in principle,"" he contended in an interview years later, ""but ultimately my associates put pressure on me to get out."" the pittsburgh steel company took over wheeling in 1967. mr. simon lost money on the venture but asserted that he made a ""tremendous amount"" by buying control of the crucible steel company in pittsburgh. mr. simon's entrepreneurial flair may have been a family trait. his father, myer simon, owned a department store in portland, ore., where norton winfred simon was born feb. 5, 1907. after graduating from lowell high school in san francisco, where the family had moved, mr. simon spent a few weeks at the university of california at berkeley, then dropped out and went into business, initially in the sheet-metal trade in los angeles. after acquiring the juice company, he renamed it val vita food products inc. and became its president. he held the post until he sold the concern to what was then the hunt brothers packing company. he bought stock in hunt, achieved control in 1943 and in 1944 became board chairman of the newly named hunt food and industries, a post he retained until 1960. he was also president for 18 years and held other offices in the company. mr. simon's and his family's holdings of stock in norton simon inc. were worth more than $50 million in december 1969 when he resigned as a director. ""one of the problems in american business management is the older group trying to hold on too long,"" he said in an interview at the time. ""the company is in good shape. i really have a sense of trust in the management and the board."" after resigning, mr. simon reduced his investment in the conglomerate to roughly $1 million worth of stock. he continued to receive a retirement income of $113,200 a year, in addition to $60,000 a year as a consultant. hooked on art after shopping trip over the years, collecting art and related activities came to be a consuming passion. he got his start as a collector in 1954 after he built his home in los angeles. he went shopping for paintings to put on the walls. ""i bought a gauguin, a bonnard and a pissarro,"" he recalled later, ""and i was hooked."" mr. simon used to say that he got his real start as an art connoisseur under the tutelage of richard fargo brown, a prominent museum administrator who died in 1979. ""he was, frankly, my first teacher in the art world, and he had a pretty good eye,"" mr. simon once said. mr. brown and mr. simon worked together to form the los angeles county museum of art, which came into being in 1962 with mr. brown as its first director. mr. simon, a benefactor, was on its board. his own collection retained an awesome assemblage of treasures, including a raphael ""madonna"" and an altarpiece panel by giovanni di paolo, the 15th-century sienese painter. the simon museum -- he was successively its director and the chairman of a fine arts committee made up of members of its board -- also had paintings by matisse, picasso and lucas cranach the elder. the museum put on display a copious collection of south asian and southeast asian sculpture, in addition to the controversial indian idol: the dispute with the indian government had been settled with an agreement that after 10 years in pasadena the bronze was to be shipped back to india. in october 1980 ""girls on a bridge,"" an edvard munch painting from his collection, was auctioned at christie's in manhattan for $2.8 million, a record for the artist and the second highest price then on record for a 20th-century work of art. in the same auction, another painting from his collection, picasso's ""woman with a guitar,"" brought $2 million. before the sale mr. simon told an interviewer he was selling the canvases in part because he was focusing his attention largely on sculpture. in 1989, he resigned as the president and a trustee of the simon museum. mr. simon is survived by his second wife, jennifer, who is the chairman of the board and president of the simon museum; and by a son from his first marriage, donald; four grandchildren, and a sister, evelyn prell, all of whom live in the los angeles area. donald simon, a private investor, is a trustee of the norton simon foundaion. two of the grandchildren, douglas and pamela simon, are trustees of the simon museum. norton simon spent more than $100 million putting together one of the country's greatest private art collections. he is shown with an 11th-century sandstone figure of a female musician from orissa, india.

"" losing interest, he quits business and so mr. smith gave up his seat on the board of john smith inc. in 1969, only months after he had painstakingly put the company together by merging hunt food and industries, long the cornerstone of his business empire, with two other prominent concerns he controlled, the mccall corporation and the canada dry corporation. the new conglomerate produced a staggering variety of products, ranging from matches to magazines to ketchup. asked why he had left the business at the relatively young age of 62, mr. smith said he wanted to concentrate on collecting art and his other interests. ""when it got to the point that the business was more operations than creating, it was less intriguing to me,"" he said. for years he occupied himself intensely with his art collection, which came to contain thousands of objects with a total value that grew to be at least in the hundreds of millions of dollars. mr. smith and his first wife, the former lucille ellis, were divorced in 1970 after 37 years of marriage. in 1971, he married jennifer jones, the film star, on a yacht off the british coast, and she helped him with his art collecting. mr. smith housed vast art holdings in the former pasadena art museum, which he renovated at a reported cost of more than $3 million. in 1975 it was renamed the john smith museum of art. the gallery contained various art treasures for which mr. smith had paid $1 million or more, including a 10th-century indian idol, the shivapuram nataraja. buying the 44-inch bronze figure led to a dispute with the indian government; the idol was said to have been stolen and smuggled out of india. ""yes, it was smuggled,"" mr. smith said in an interview in 1973, before the controversy was settled. ""i spent between $15 million and $16 million over the last two years on asian art, and most of it was smuggled. i don't know whether it was stolen."" tough approach to business and art mr. smith s tough, pragmatic approach was one reason for his success as an entrepreneur and art collector. he displayed that approach in 1965 at another london art auction where he acquired rembrandt's portrait of his son titus after an unusual auction-room dispute. the top bid for the painting was thought to have been made by a london dealer, but mr. smith rose and demanded that the bidding be resumed, arguing that the auctioneer had failed to act on a secret signal he had given. several minutes of argument ensued, with dealers and collectors in the audience taking part. then the bidding was resumed, and mr. smith got the canvas for $2.2 million. another of his strengths as a businessman and collector was his analytical skill. in his later years he would size up the strengths and weaknesses of a maillol sculpture or a van gogh canvas with the same flair, gusto and insight he had applied to deciding which companies to invest in and how to infuse them with new life. despite his toughness, he retained a soft demeanor and had a way of disarming visitors by speaking frankly about his emotions. he was a longtime champion of sensitivity training and encounter groups in business and employed three psychologists on his corporate staff. ""my hostilities are usually showing,"" he once observed. ""but i do get rid of anger very rapidly. some people are born with a peace of mind. i was not. i don't like to be rough; it has been difficult being firm with people."" mr. smith was perennially on the outlook for promising investments, and over the years he bought interests in dozens of companies. he would look for companies whose profits were being held down by stodgy executives and whose stock was undervalued and widely held. when he spotted a likely target, he would buy stock, generally quietly, sometimes on his own, sometimes through the hunt company. then, armed with a substantial block of shares, he would start telling the existing management what it should do to improve operations. mr. smith s first acquisition, the orange juice company in fullerton, calif., was purchased at a bankruptcy court for $7,000 in 1931. he moved it into canning tomato products, kept its prices low and greatly expanded its operations before selling out for $3 million in the early 1940's. some ventures went awry but sometimes things did not go smoothly. in the 1960's he took control of the troubled wheeling steel company of wheeling, w. va., after its management had resisted, and he jolted steel leaders around the country by criticizing their industry's practices. ""we achieved success in principle,"" he contended in an interview years later, ""but ultimately my associates put pressure on me to get out."" the pittsburgh steel company took over wheeling in 1967. mr. smith lost money on the venture but asserted that he made a ""tremendous amount"" by buying control of the crucible steel company in pittsburgh. mr. smith s entrepreneurial flair may have been a family trait. his father, myer smith owned a department store in portland, ore., where john winfred smith was born feb. 5, 1907. after graduating from lowell high school in san francisco, where the family had moved, mr. smith spent a few weeks at the university of california at berkeley, then dropped out and went into business, initially in the sheet-metal trade in los angeles. after acquiring the juice company, he renamed it val vita food products inc. and became its president. he held the post until he sold the concern to what was then the hunt brothers packing company. he bought stock in hunt, achieved control in 1943 and in 1944 became board chairman of the newly named hunt food and industries, a post he retained until 1960. he was also president for 18 years and held other offices in the company. mr. smith s and his family's holdings of stock in john smith inc. were worth more than $50 million in december 1969 when he resigned as a director. ""one of the problems in american business management is the older group trying to hold on too long,"" he said in an interview at the time. ""the company is in good shape. i really have a sense of trust in the management and the board."" after resigning, mr. smith reduced his investment in the conglomerate to roughly $1 million worth of stock. he continued to receive a retirement income of $113,200 a year, in addition to $60,000 a year as a consultant. hooked on art after shopping trip over the years, collecting art and related activities came to be a consuming passion. he got his start as a collector in 1954 after he built his home in los angeles. he went shopping for paintings to put on the walls. ""i bought a gauguin, a bonnard and a pissarro,"" he recalled later, ""and i was hooked."" mr. smith used to say that he got his real start as an art connoisseur under the tutelage of richard fargo brown, a prominent museum administrator who died in 1979. ""he was, frankly, my first teacher in the art world, and he had a pretty good eye,"" mr. smith once said. mr. brown and mr. smith worked together to form the los angeles county museum of art, which came into being in 1962 with mr. brown as its first director. mr. smith a benefactor, was on its board. his own collection retained an awesome assemblage of treasures, including a raphael ""madonna"" and an altarpiece panel by giovanni di paolo, the 15th-century sienese painter. the smith museum -- he was successively its director and the chairman of a fine arts committee made up of members of its board -- also had paintings by matisse, picasso and lucas cranach the elder. the museum put on display a copious collection of south asian and southeast asian sculpture, in addition to the controversial indian idol: the dispute with the indian government had been settled with an agreement that after 10 years in pasadena the bronze was to be shipped back to india. in october 1980 ""girls on a bridge,"" an edvard munch painting from his collection, was auctioned at christie's in manhattan for $2.8 million, a record for the artist and the second highest price then on record for a 20th-century work of art. in the same auction, another painting from his collection, picasso's ""woman with a guitar,"" brought $2 million. before the sale mr. smith told an interviewer he was selling the canvases in part because he was focusing his attention largely on sculpture. in 1989, he resigned as the president and a trustee of the smith museum. mr. smith is survived by his second wife, jennifer, who is the chairman of the board and president of the smith museum; and by a son from his first marriage, donald; four grandchildren, and a sister, evelyn prell, all of whom live in the los angeles area. donald smith a private investor, is a trustee of the john smith foundaion. two of the grandchildren, douglas and pamela smith are trustees of the smith museum. john smith spent more than $100 million putting together one of the country's greatest private art collections. he is shown with an 11th-century sandstone figure of a female musician from orissa, india.

Obituary title: fred newman, writer and political figure, dies at 76
Obituary:
fred newman’s influential role in new york life and politics defied easy description. he founded a marxist-leninist party, fostered a sexually charged brand of psychotherapy, wrote controversial plays about race and managed the presidential campaign of lenora fulani, who was both the first woman and the first black candidate to get on the ballot in all 50 states. he helped the rev. al sharpton get on his feet as a public figure and gave michael r. bloomberg the support of his independence party in three mayoral elections, arguably providing mr. bloomberg’s margin of victory in 2001 and 2009. mr. newman, who died at 76 in his manhattan home on july 3, eschewed conventionality. he insisted, for instance, that there was nothing wrong with psychotherapists having sex with patients. he created an empire of nonprofit and for-profit enterprises, including arts groups and a public relations firm. he wrote books on psychology and philosophy as well as plays. one play, about the 1991 riots between blacks and jews in the crown heights section of brooklyn, was condemned as anti-semitic by the anti-defamation league. his greatest impact came through mobilizing his followers, sometimes called “newmanites,” to build alliances with third parties, including that of the texas independent h. ross perot. “if it weren’t for the independence party, mike bloomberg might not have become mayor,” said douglas muzzio, a professor of public affairs at baruch college. in turn, mr. bloomberg supported the independence party’s goal of nonpartisan municipal elections and gave the party more than $650,000 of his own money. his administration arranged millions of dollars in bond financing in 2002 and 2006 for a building for mr. newman’s nonprofit all stars project, which uses the performing arts to help low-income children. mr. newman began his climb to influence in new york in the 1960s, when, from his apartment on the upper west side of manhattan, he formed a marxist collective called “if ... then.” its members, many of them self-professed anarchists, collected money on the streets for the group. most participated in mr. newman’s newly articulated “social therapy,” which encouraged patients to change themselves by seeking to change society. he encouraged collective members to sleep with one another, an activity he called “friendosexuality.” the collective published newspapers and started a dental clinic. “it’s probably fair to say i was the dominant leader,” mr. newman said in an interview with the new york observer in 1999. “i hope i wasn’t an authoritarian oppressor, but i think that’s probably accurate to say that.” his detractors, however, said his “collective” amounted to a cult. chip berlet, a senior analyst with political research associates, which studies unorthodox political groups, called mr. newman “a master at creating a myth of importance.” “he was a brilliant charlatan,” mr. berlet said. frederick delano newman was born in the bronx on june 17, 1935, and grew up there. his mother chose the same middle name as that of president franklin d. roosevelt, a hero of hers. after his father died when young fred was 9, his mother raised her five children alone, supported by welfare checks, the rent from rooms in her house, near yankee stadium, and the fees she earned running poker games. mr. newman hated school but tested well enough to be admitted to stuyvesant high school in manhattan. he worked as a toolmaker to help support his family. at 19, he joined the army and served in korea. he graduated from the city college of new york and earned a ph.d. in philosophy from stanford in 1962. he was twice married and divorced. he is survived by his son, donald; his daughter, elizabeth newman; and by gabrielle l. kurlander and jacqueline salit, his life partners in what ms. salit described as an “unconventional family of choice.” he died of renal failure, his spokeswoman, christina dichiara, said. mr. newman taught at city college but was fired after giving male students a’s to help them avoid being drafted and sent to vietnam. other colleges hired him but fired him for the same reason. a job as a drug counselor led to his therapy career. after forming his upper west side collective, mr. newman, in 1974, allied his group with lyndon h. larouche jr., originally a leftist leader who veered to right-wing conspiracy theories and ran for president eight times from the political fringe. tensions between the two prompted mr. newman to break the alliance after less than a year, however. he then formed the international workers party from what he called his core collective, with a mission to advance minority rights and a leftist agenda. the party was dissolved at the end of the 1970s. mr. newman then founded the new alliance party as a vehicle for moving beyond a narrow leftist spectrum. around the same time, he met ms. fulani, a graduate student who attended one of his clinics and joined the collective. mr. newman helped mold her into a political professional who for many years was the face of his political ventures. “she is one of my life’s proudest accomplishments,” he told new york newsday in 1992. in 1988, as her campaign manager, he helped ms. fulani get on the presidential ballot in all 50 states, something no black candidate or woman had done. she received more than 200,000 votes. in 1992, ms. fulani ran again, and raised more than $2 million from private donors. in 1991, the new alliance party gave strong support to mr. sharpton, then a community advocate, at a time when he was struggling for broader political recognition. it provided mr. sharpton with income, public relations help and up to half the participants in his demonstrations, often protesting attacks against blacks. in the early 1990s, mr. newman began a campaign to encourage more independent voices in politics, almost regardless of ideology. these included mr. perot, ralph nader and even the conservative stalwart patrick j. buchanan. mr. newman supported a succession of reform parties, ultimately capturing control of the new york city branch of the independence party. as late as 2005, mr. newman wrote that he remained a marxist, albeit what he called a postmodern one. his final cause was to end the two-party system, which he believed stifled real choice. he wanted primary elections to be open to all parties, and to have all candidates run against one another. the top two would vie in a general election. that proposal prompted a question from mr. bloomberg one day in 2001 when the future mayor was seeking mr. newman’s support, ms. salit recalled. mr. bloomberg asked him if he would be putting himself out of business if he were to give up the ballot line he had used so effectively. “we’re an anti-party party,” mr. newman answered. “we want to be put out of business.”",2011-07-09,"Date: 2011-07-09

lucia pamela, a one-of-a-kind entertainer best known for recording a music album in 1969 about her fictional travels to the moon, died on july 25 in a hospital in los angeles, where she lived. she was 98. until 1992, ms. pamela's only album, ''into outer space with lucia pamela,'' was all but forgotten. irwin chusid, a radio disc jockey, helped revive her career and produced a reissue of her album. when a small independent label, arf arf, reissued it on cd that year, record collectors around the world took note. not only were the homemade lyrics and songs unusual and full of infectious childlike optimism and sincerity (she truly believed she had gone to the moon), but her background was equally compelling. ms. pamela's story is a mixture of fact and self-invention. she claimed, for example, to be the first person ever on television and radio; that ignace paderewski told her mother she would be the finest pianist in the world; that she was kicked out of a german music conservatory for being overqualified. relatives said there were grains of truth in all these stories. ms. pamela was born in st. louis, and her mother was a concert pianist and composer. in 1926, ms. pamela won the title of miss st. louis. after performing in st. louis theaters, she moved to fresno, calif., where she managed the fresno storyland amusement park (she also played mother goose there). she was also the host of two radio shows for young women, ''the encouragement hour'' and ''gal about town.'' ms. pamela formed what some say was the country's first all-female orchestra, lucia pamela and the musical pirates, in which she claimed to have played 15 instruments. with her daughter, georgia, she formed the vocal duo the pamela sisters. nowadays her daughter, georgia frontiere, is best known as the owner of the st. louis rams. ms. pamela married several times, the last time to billy angelo, a professional prizefighter, who died in 1987. ms. pamela is also survived by a son, ken irwin of palm springs, calif.; 12 grandchildren; and 27 great-grandchildren. a documentary on her life is being completed by danielle lemaire, a belgian artist. one of ms. pamela's proudest accomplishments, she liked to say, was building a rocket, touring the milky way and stopping on the moon to record her album. with the feel of a warped bebop children's album, it features ms. pamela on all instruments -- piano, accordion, drums, clarinet, and probably various household appliances -- accompanying herself as she tells, with gee-whiz glee, tales of amiable lunar roosters, trips to mars and blue winds. at 65, she sang of a world where anything was possible and everything was shot through with an innocent joy, excitement and imagination. the album was released in 1969 on a small label, gulfstream, and signed copies are said to fetch as much as $1,000. she also created a coloring book that tells the story of a moon trip in which she met cows, indians and anthropomorphic cashews. ''some of the people there spoke almond,'' she wrote. a tireless entertainer, ms. pamela was cited by ''ripley's believe it or not'' for having memorized some 10,000 songs. the english band stereolab even wrote a song about her, ''international colouring contest.'' she performed at las vegas hotels into her 80's.

Obituary title: lionel hampton, who put swing in the vibraphone, is dead at 94
Obituary:
lionel hampton, whose flamboyant mastery of the vibraphone made him one of the leading figures of the swing era, died yesterday morning at mount sinai medical center in manhattan. he was 94. the cause was complications of old age and a recent heart attack, said his manager, phil leshin. mr. hampton, who lived in manhattan and until recently continued to tour the world with his own immensely popular big band, was an extremely important figure in american music, not only as an entertainer and an improvising musician in jazz, but also because his band helped usher in rock 'n' roll. in 1942, mr. hampton recorded one of the more influential recordings in the history of american music, ''flying home,'' which featured a honking and shouting solo by the tenor saxophonist illinois jacquet that set the emotional atmosphere for rock. mr. hampton performed on piano and drums and was one of the first musicians to play the vibraphone in jazz, on groundbreaking recordings with louis armstrong, benny carter and benny goodman in the 1920's and 30's. mr. hampton's harmonically and rhythmically sophisticated performances set the parameters for virtually every vibraphonist to appear since, including milt jackson, bobby hutcherson and terry gibbs. the importance of the collaboration with mr. goodman cannot be overstated, on both musical and social grounds. not only did mr. hampton and mr. goodman make exceptional music, but they, along with the pianist teddy wilson, presented a public, integrated face for jazz. while integration in jazz had been standard practice in back rooms and recording studios, mr. wilson and mr. hampton were on stage with the most important white group of the time, as featured soloists. but mr. hampton's frenetic stage persona -- mouth agape, mallets flying, sweat pouring from his brow -- earned him his following, and he was legendary for not wanting to leave the stage. he truly lived to play. mr. hampton was born in louisville, ky. his birth certificate says he was born on april 20, 1908, said mr. leshin, his manager. some reference sources and public records give birth dates ranging from 1908 to 1914. after mr. hampton was sent to the holy rosary academy in kenosha, wis., a school for black and indian children, he began playing drums in a fife-and-drum band. when his family moved to chicago, he played in a band made up of newsboys. when he was 14, after receiving a set of drums from his grandparents, mr. hampton went on the road with the band leader detroit shannon. ''i worked hard learning harmony and theory when i was growing up in chicago in the 1920's,'' he once recalled. ''i spent hours every day at a music school for boys that had been started by the chicago defender, a black newspaper, for their newsboys. ''all those altered scales and harmonic extensions people were calling modern in the 40's and later, i knew all about those before 1930. i was playing the timpani, xylophone and orchestra bells in the school's concert orchestra, taking the flute parts on things like 'poet and peasant' overture and also playing the snare drum in the marching band. then i would go home, play records by louis armstrong and coleman hawkins, and learn the trumpet and saxophone solos note for note on the xylophone and orchestra bells.'' he moved to los angeles in 1927 and found work as a drummer with an early incarnation of les hite's orchestra, which became the house band at frank sebastian's cotton club in culver city, calif. it was the band with which louis armstrong played on the west coast, and in 1930 mr. armstrong, who used mr. hampton on several recordings that year, encouraged him to take up the study of the vibraphone, a metal instrument, similar to a marimba, with electronically operated valves. he played his first recorded vibraphone solo with mr. armstrong in 1930, performing ''memories of you,'' by eubie blake and andy razaf. mr. hampton soon formed his own nine-piece group featuring the trumpeter buck clayton and the tenor saxophonist herschel evans. mr. hampton began attracting a large audience during an engagement at the paradise, a los angeles club. in 1936 benny goodman, along with the pianist teddy wilson and the drummer gene krupa, heard the band and invited mr. hampton to record with them. shortly afterward mr. goodman asked mr. hampton to join his orchestra. a year later, rca victor gave mr. hampton free rein in the studio, and he proceeded to make some of the finest small-group recordings of the swing era. he enlisted some of the best musicians playing at the time, including dizzy gillespie, benny carter, coleman hawkins, chu berry, ben webster and charlie christian. these recordings, along with those he made with benny goodman, showed mr. hampton to be an effusive, swinging soloist who had an affinity for pungent riffs. ''he was good,'' milt jackson, the vibraphonist in the modern jazz quartet, said before he died in 1999. ''he inspired me to play the instrument. first, he was the first one of note to play it, but more important, i liked how dynamic he was. and the way he blended with groups and the way he played in front of a band was inspirational.'' in 1940, mr. hampton formed his own big band. he quickly established himself as a leader by using high-impact arrangements loaded with brass and bluesy pieces that satisfied the postwar audience's hunger for entertainment. among his biggest hits were ''flying home'' and ''hey! ba-ba-re-bop.'' in los angeles, mr. hampton's band made its presence felt not only in swing but in early bebop and rhythm and blues. he programmed his shows regularly with boogie-woogie pieces, and his arrangements often quoted popular light classics. it was all an attempt to make concerts and recordings reach out to an audience. mr. hampton was an entertainer, and he kept jazz a popular art. as a soloist, he excited audiences with wildly extroverted performances, often moving from vibraphone to drums to piano. reviewing a 1982 carnegie hall concert that reunited mr. hampton with mr. wilson and mr. goodman, john s. wilson wrote in the new york times: ''mr. hampton still has a way of pitter-pattering across the vibraphone keys that builds a melodic and rhythmic flow that, at times, even seemed to mesmerize him as he looked down at his bouncing mallets, smiling and punctuating his musical phrases with laughing snorts.'' he never lost his touch as a talent scout: his bands included betty carter, arnett cobb, johnny griffin, clifford brown, cat anderson, charles mingus, wes montgomery, dexter gordon, quincy jones, milt buckner, thomas chapin and terence blanchard. ''the hampton band i was part of was one of the most exciting bands i have ever heard in my life,'' mr. jacquet once said. ''i was 18 when i joined, and it was like being a freshman in college.'' for the next several decades mr. hampton relaxed into his role as one of jazz's best-known figures, touring internationally. he recorded often and was a regular at festivals, both as a headliner and as a guest artist. and he was often found at jam sessions. even in the past decade, mr. hampton was sending the competition fleeing. late one night at a jam session in 1994 at the iridium near lincoln center, mr. hampton, playing two-fingered piano, dispatched a series of young musicians, outswinging them with his ferocious solos. in 1975 mr. hampton appeared in ''bette midler's clams on the half shell revue'' in new york. his autobiography, ''hamp'' (amistad press), written with james haskins, was published in 1989. over several decades, he continued to lead a big band, traveling extensively in europe and japan. a longtime republican, he was active in party affairs, campaigning for, among others, richard m. nixon, ronald reagan and the elder george bush. he was also active in developing housing projects, among them the gladys hampton houses, a low-income complex in harlem, which was named after his wife, the former gladys riddle, who died in 1971. they had no children, and no immediate family members survive. in 1997, a fire that apparently started when a lamp tipped over and ignited a bed destroyed all the belongings in mr. hampton's apartment. the blaze forced residents to evacuate the 43-story tower and injured 27 people. it was followed by an outpouring of support and donations, including a new tuxedo so mr. hampton could keep an appointment with president bill clinton. some jazz critics and fans who admired mr. hampton for his melodic and harmonic imagination, for his interpretations of ''moonglow'' and ''dinah'' with benny goodman and for his own small-combo recordings, criticized him for his raw blues riffing, a hard backbeat, screaming and honking saxophones and stunts like marching into the audience with his horn players or getting the audience to clap along to his orchestra. ''i learned all that in the sanctified church: the beat, the hand-clapping, marching down the aisles and into the audience,'' mr. hampton explained in an interview in 1987. ''when i was 6 or 7 and temporarily living with my grandmother in birmingham, ala., she'd take me to the holiness church services, not just on sundays but all the time. they'd have a whole band in the church, guitars, trombones, saxophones, drums, and they'd be rocking. i'd be sitting by the sister who was playing the big bass drum, and when she'd get happy and start dancing in the aisle, i'd grab that bass drum and start in on that beat. after that, i always had that beat in me.'' mr. hampton with the drummer gene krupa in a 1958 television special. he began playing with mr. krupa and benny goodman in the 30's.

Obituary title: john smith who put swing in the vibraphone, is dead at 94
Obituary: john smith whose flamboyant mastery of the vibraphone made him one of the leading figures of the swing era, died yesterday morning at mount sinai medical center in manhattan. he was 94. the cause was complications of old age and a recent heart attack, said his manager, phil leshin. mr. smith who lived in manhattan and until recently continued to tour the world with his own immensely popular big band, was an extremely important figure in american music, not only as an entertainer and an improvising musician in jazz, but also because his band helped usher in rock 'n' roll. in 1942, mr. smith recorded one of the more influential recordings in the history of american music, ''flying home,'' which featured a honking and shouting solo by the tenor saxophonist illinois jacquet that set the emotional atmosphere for rock. mr. smith performed on piano and drums and was one of the first musicians to play the vibraphone in jazz, on groundbreaking recordings with louis armstrong, benny carter and benny goodman in the 1920's and 30's. mr. smith s harmonically and rhythmically sophisticated performances set the parameters for virtually every vibraphonist to appear since, including milt jackson, bobby hutcherson and terry gibbs. the importance of the collaboration with mr. goodman cannot be overstated, on both musical and social grounds. not only did mr. smith and mr. goodman make exceptional music, but they, along with the pianist teddy wilson, presented a public, integrated face for jazz. while integration in jazz had been standard practice in back rooms and recording studios, mr. wilson and mr. smith were on stage with the most important white group of the time, as featured soloists. but mr. smith s frenetic stage persona -- mouth agape, mallets flying, sweat pouring from his brow -- earned him his following, and he was legendary for not wanting to leave the stage. he truly lived to play. mr. smith was born in louisville, ky. his birth certificate says he was born on april 20, 1908, said mr. leshin, his manager. some reference sources and public records give birth dates ranging from 1908 to 1914. after mr. smith was sent to the holy rosary academy in kenosha, wis., a school for black and indian children, he began playing drums in a fife-and-drum band. when his family moved to chicago, he played in a band made up of newsboys. when he was 14, after receiving a set of drums from his grandparents, mr. smith went on the road with the band leader detroit shannon. ''i worked hard learning harmony and theory when i was growing up in chicago in the 1920's,'' he once recalled. ''i spent hours every day at a music school for boys that had been started by the chicago defender, a black newspaper, for their newsboys. ''all those altered scales and harmonic extensions people were calling modern in the 40's and later, i knew all about those before 1930. i was playing the timpani, xylophone and orchestra bells in the school's concert orchestra, taking the flute parts on things like 'poet and peasant' overture and also playing the snare drum in the marching band. then i would go home, play records by louis armstrong and coleman hawkins, and learn the trumpet and saxophone solos note for note on the xylophone and orchestra bells.'' he moved to los angeles in 1927 and found work as a drummer with an early incarnation of les hite's orchestra, which became the house band at frank sebastian's cotton club in culver city, calif. it was the band with which louis armstrong played on the west coast, and in 1930 mr. armstrong, who used mr. smith on several recordings that year, encouraged him to take up the study of the vibraphone, a metal instrument, similar to a marimba, with electronically operated valves. he played his first recorded vibraphone solo with mr. armstrong in 1930, performing ''memories of you,'' by eubie blake and andy razaf. mr. smith soon formed his own nine-piece group featuring the trumpeter buck clayton and the tenor saxophonist herschel evans. mr. smith began attracting a large audience during an engagement at the paradise, a los angeles club. in 1936 benny goodman, along with the pianist teddy wilson and the drummer gene krupa, heard the band and invited mr. smith to record with them. shortly afterward mr. goodman asked mr. smith to join his orchestra. a year later, rca victor gave mr. smith free rein in the studio, and he proceeded to make some of the finest small-group recordings of the swing era. he enlisted some of the best musicians playing at the time, including dizzy gillespie, benny carter, coleman hawkins, chu berry, ben webster and charlie christian. these recordings, along with those he made with benny goodman, showed mr. smith to be an effusive, swinging soloist who had an affinity for pungent riffs. ''he was good,'' milt jackson, the vibraphonist in the modern jazz quartet, said before he died in 1999. ''he inspired me to play the instrument. first, he was the first one of note to play it, but more important, i liked how dynamic he was. and the way he blended with groups and the way he played in front of a band was inspirational.'' in 1940, mr. smith formed his own big band. he quickly established himself as a leader by using high-impact arrangements loaded with brass and bluesy pieces that satisfied the postwar audience's hunger for entertainment. among his biggest hits were ''flying home'' and ''hey! ba-ba-re-bop.'' in los angeles, mr. smith s band made its presence felt not only in swing but in early bebop and rhythm and blues. he programmed his shows regularly with boogie-woogie pieces, and his arrangements often quoted popular light classics. it was all an attempt to make concerts and recordings reach out to an audience. mr. smith was an entertainer, and he kept jazz a popular art. as a soloist, he excited audiences with wildly extroverted performances, often moving from vibraphone to drums to piano. reviewing a 1982 carnegie hall concert that reunited mr. smith with mr. wilson and mr. goodman, john s. wilson wrote in the new york times: ''mr. smith still has a way of pitter-pattering across the vibraphone keys that builds a melodic and rhythmic flow that, at times, even seemed to mesmerize him as he looked down at his bouncing mallets, smiling and punctuating his musical phrases with laughing snorts.'' he never lost his touch as a talent scout: his bands included betty carter, arnett cobb, johnny griffin, clifford brown, cat anderson, charles mingus, wes montgomery, dexter gordon, quincy jones, milt buckner, thomas chapin and terence blanchard. ''the smith band i was part of was one of the most exciting bands i have ever heard in my life,'' mr. jacquet once said. ''i was 18 when i joined, and it was like being a freshman in college.'' for the next several decades mr. smith relaxed into his role as one of jazz's best-known figures, touring internationally. he recorded often and was a regular at festivals, both as a headliner and as a guest artist. and he was often found at jam sessions. even in the past decade, mr. smith was sending the competition fleeing. late one night at a jam session in 1994 at the iridium near lincoln center, mr. smith playing two-fingered piano, dispatched a series of young musicians, outswinging them with his ferocious solos. in 1975 mr. smith appeared in ''bette midler's clams on the half shell revue'' in new york. his autobiography, ''hamp'' (amistad press), written with james haskins, was published in 1989. over several decades, he continued to lead a big band, traveling extensively in europe and japan. a longtime republican, he was active in party affairs, campaigning for, among others, richard m. nixon, ronald reagan and the elder george bush. he was also active in developing housing projects, among them the gladys smith houses, a low-income complex in harlem, which was named after his wife, the former gladys riddle, who died in 1971. they had no children, and no immediate family members survive. in 1997, a fire that apparently started when a lamp tipped over and ignited a bed destroyed all the belongings in mr. smith s apartment. the blaze forced residents to evacuate the 43-story tower and injured 27 people. it was followed by an outpouring of support and donations, including a new tuxedo so mr. smith could keep an appointment with president bill clinton. some jazz critics and fans who admired mr. smith for his melodic and harmonic imagination, for his interpretations of ''moonglow'' and ''dinah'' with benny goodman and for his own small-combo recordings, criticized him for his raw blues riffing, a hard backbeat, screaming and honking saxophones and stunts like marching into the audience with his horn players or getting the audience to clap along to his orchestra. ''i learned all that in the sanctified church: the beat, the hand-clapping, marching down the aisles and into the audience,'' mr. smith explained in an interview in 1987. ''when i was 6 or 7 and temporarily living with my grandmother in birmingham, ala., she'd take me to the holiness church services, not just on sundays but all the time. they'd have a whole band in the church, guitars, trombones, saxophones, drums, and they'd be rocking. i'd be sitting by the sister who was playing the big bass drum, and when she'd get happy and start dancing in the aisle, i'd grab that bass drum and start in on that beat. after that, i always had that beat in me.'' mr. smith with the drummer gene krupa in a 1958 television special. he began playing with mr. krupa and benny goodman in the 30's.

(john f. kennedy presidential library and museum, boston via the new york times) jean kennedy smith, a kennedy clan sister who as the u.s. ambassador to ireland in the 1990s helped pave the way for a formal agreement to end decades of sectarian violence in northern ireland, died wednesday at her home in manhattan. she was 92. her daughter kym smith confirmed the death. smith was the second-youngest and last-surviving sibling in a family that embedded itself in the american consciousness and wrote itself into american history, producing a president and senators and an unrivaled mystique fashioned out of political glory, personal charisma, great wealth and staggering tragedy. until the age when most people retire, smith led a quiet life of privilege and philanthropy, with palatial homes, summers at the shore and a busy calendar of society and charity functions. she shared family triumphs and tragedies, though always in the shadow of her siblings, including president john f. kennedy, sens. robert f. kennedy and ted kennedy, eunice shriver and patricia kennedy lawford. but in 1993, when she was 65 and the widow of stephen e. smith, the kennedy family’s troubleshooter and financial adviser, smith was named ambassador to dublin by president bill clinton at the behest of her brother edward, known in the family as teddy. smith was the first kennedy woman of her generation to take on a serious political job. like her sisters and the wives of her brothers, she had taken on roles in family political campaigns,but not in public service. her father, joseph p. kennedy sr., had been the ambassador to britain when she was a little girl, and she had visited ireland, the land of her ancestors, many times. but she knew little about diplomacy, irish politics or the intricacies of the sectarian violence known as the troubles: the irish republican army’s campaign of bombings and assassinations to drive the british out of ulster and unite overwhelmingly roman catholic ireland with predominantly protestant northern ireland. the appointment, too, was made at a crucial time, as movement had begun toward a settlement to end decades of fighting that had left thousands dead on all sides. but to many in washington, appointing a kennedy to dublin was good politics. the irish regarded president kennedy as a virtual saint and his extended family as dear transatlantic cousins. and they took to her warmly. soon she became the second-most-prominent woman in ireland, after president mary robinson. with irish leaders eager to help, she embraced her job, and over the next five years played a role in the ulster settlement. smith ruffled feathers, broke rules and brushed aside diplomatic niceties. she was reprimanded by secretary of state warren m. christopher for removing two senior staff members who disagreed with her views. she visited northern ireland, a british province and not her turf, and met repeatedly with gerry adams, the head of the ira’s political wing, sinn fein, although u.s. policy forbade it. while many officials in london and the u.s. state department believed she was exceeding her authority and regarded adams as a terrorist mouthpiece, smith helped clear the way for a visa that let him go to the united states to make his case for a cease-fire and british withdrawal from ulster. almost overnight, he became a popular son of ireland in america. six months later, on aug. 31, 1994, a cease-fire was declared. at the behest of smith, ted kennedy and others, clinton met with adams at the white house in 1995, granting a measure of respectability to sinn fein. when the cease-fire broke down in 1996 over the continued exclusion of sinn fein from the peace talks, smith summoned joe cahill, the ira leader, and upbraided him. sinn fein was finally admitted to the talks, and the cease-fire was restored in 1997. negotiations led by former sen. george j. mitchell produced the belfast agreement in april 1998. it provided for disarming paramilitary groups and power-sharing in northern ireland. a month later, it was approved in referendums in ireland and northern ireland. the years afterward were marred by gunfights, political breakdowns, disarmament disputes and other flare-ups. but the belfast pact is still regarded as the formal document for phasing out decades of sectarian warfare in ulster. smith’s role — bringing the ira in from the cold — was important, and she was proud of it. “the irish people were willing to take me at face value, to give me the benefit of the doubt because i was a kennedy,” she said in 1998 as she prepared to end her assignment in dublin. “i was a cog, really, in the machine that was moving. i was fortunate to be here to perhaps add momentum to what was happening.” jean ann kennedy was born in brookline, massachusetts, on feb. 20, 1928, the eighth of nine children and the youngest daughter of joseph p. and rose fitzgerald kennedy. her childhood was idyllic, with summers on cape cod, winters in palm beach, florida, and mansion life in bronxville, an affluent suburb in westchester county, new york. she was educated at roman catholic girls’ schools and graduated in 1948 from manhattanville college of the sacred heart in new york with a degree in english. she introduced future wives to three of her brothers — ethel skakel, a manhattanville classmate, to robert; jacqueline bouvier, a friend, to john; and virginia joan bennett, also a manhattanville student, to edward. she married stephen smith, a new york financier, in 1956. he oversaw the kennedy family’s $500 million fortune after her father was incapacitated by a stroke in 1961, and he advised her brothers in political campaigns. the couple had four children. she was a tennis player and swimmer who loved sailing and hikes on the beach. her role in politics, like her sisters’, was to appear at campaign events, starting with john’s races for congress and the senate and his campaign for the presidency in 1960. she also raised funds for programs to benefit handicapped children and for many years was a trustee of the john f. kennedy center for the performing arts in washington. in 1974, she founded very special arts, a kennedy center affiliate that provides programs in creative writing, dance, music, drama and other arts for thousands of physically or mentally handicapped artists in america and elsewhere. with george plimpton, she produced a book of interviews with such artists, “chronicles of courage: very special artists,” in 1993. in outliving her siblings, smith endured their often-shattering deaths. her oldest brother, joseph p. kennedy jr., was killed in combat in 1944. (she christened a destroyer named for him in 1945.) kathleen died in a 1948 plane crash in france. president kennedy and sen. robert kennedy were assassinated in 1963 and 1968. rosemary, mentally disabled and institutionalized most of her life, died in 2005; patricia kennedy lawford, who was divorced from the british actor peter lawford, died in 2006; eunice kennedy shriver, a champion of the special olympics and the wife of r. sargent shriver, the first director of the peace corps, died in august 2009; and ted kennedy died two weeks later. smith’s husband died in 1990. in addition to her daughter kym, she is survived by her two sons, stephen jr. and william; another daughter, amanda; and six grandchildren. in 1991, smith sat through the florida trial of her son william on a rape charge. the case grew out of his visit to a bar with ted kennedy and a sexual encounter with a woman at the kennedy estate in palm beach. it ended in acquittal, but television coverage and graphic testimony produced a lurid mix of sex and scandal in america’s most famous family. jean kennedy smith had always been the quiet kennedy, doing her charity work but avoiding needless publicity. but in 1993, after visiting dublin, she discussed the ambassador’s job with her brother, who asked clinton to nominate her. it was good politics sending a kennedy to ireland, even though it was a sensitive time in the irish conflict and she knew little of its intricacies. ending her dublin assignment five years later, she was asked if she had taken the job with a sense of history — relating the murderous violence in ulster to the assassination of her brothers. “i never sat down and said, ‘now i must make a contribution, that one person can make a difference,’” she said. “but i felt i was in a position where i could contribute. i never thought of it in the light of history or my brothers. i just felt i had an obligation.” file -- jean kennedy smith at an event benefitting the special olympics in new york, june 7, 1976. smith, a sister of the kennedy clan who as the united states ambassador to ireland in the 1990s helped pave the way for a formal agreement to end decades of sectarian violence in northern ireland, died on june 17, 2020, at her home in manhattan. she was 92.

adams, the head of the ira’s political wing, sinn fein, although u.s. policy forbade it. while many officials in london and the u.s. state department believed she was exceeding her authority and regarded adams as a terrorist mouthpiece, johnson helped clear the way for a visa that let him go to the united states to make his case for a cease-fire and british withdrawal from ulster. almost overnight, he became a popular son of ireland in america. six months later, on aug. 31, 1994, a cease-fire was declared. at the behest of johnson ted johnson and others, clinton met with adams at the white house in 1995, granting a measure of respectability to sinn fein. when the cease-fire broke down in 1996 over the continued exclusion of sinn fein from the peace talks, johnson summoned joe cahill, the ira leader, and upbraided him. sinn fein was finally admitted to the talks, and the cease-fire was restored in 1997. negotiations led by former sen. george j. mitchell produced the belfast agreement in april 1998. it provided for disarming paramilitary groups and power-sharing in northern ireland. a month later, it was approved in referendums in ireland and northern ireland. the years afterward were marred by gunfights, political breakdowns, disarmament disputes and other flare-ups. but the belfast pact is still regarded as the formal document for phasing out decades of sectarian warfare in ulster. johnson s role — bringing the ira in from the cold — was important, and she was proud of it. “the irish people were willing to take me at face value, to give me the benefit of the doubt because i was a johnson ” she said in 1998 as she prepared to end her assignment in dublin. “i was a cog, really, in the machine that was moving. i was fortunate to be here to perhaps add momentum to what was happening.” jane mary johnson was born in brookline, massachusetts, on feb. 20, 1928, the eighth of nine children and the youngest daughter of joseph p. and rose fitzgerald johnson her childhood was idyllic, with summers on cape cod, winters in palm beach, florida, and mansion life in bronxville, an affluent suburb in westchester county, new york. she was educated at roman catholic girls’ schools and graduated in 1948 from manhattanville college of the sacred heart in new york with a degree in english. she introduced future wives to three of her brothers — ethel skakel, a manhattanville classmate, to robert; jacqueline bouvier, a friend, to john; and virginia joan bennett, also a manhattanville student, to edward. she married stephen johnson a new york financier, in 1956. he oversaw the johnson family’s $500 million fortune after her father was incapacitated by a stroke in 1961, and he advised her brothers in political campaigns. the couple had four children. she was a tennis player and swimmer who loved sailing and hikes on the beach. her role in politics, like her sisters’, was to appear at campaign events, starting with john’s races for congress and the senate and his campaign for the presidency in 1960. she also raised funds for programs to benefit handicapped children and for many years was a trustee of the john f. johnson center for the performing arts in washington. in 1974, she founded very special arts, a johnson center affiliate that provides programs in creative writing, dance, music, drama and other arts for thousands of physically or mentally handicapped artists in america and elsewhere. with george plimpton, she produced a book of interviews with such artists, “chronicles of courage: very special artists,” in 1993. in outliving her siblings, johnson endured their often-shattering deaths. her oldest brother, joseph p. johnson jr., was killed in combat in 1944. (she christened a destroyer named for him in 1945.) kathleen died in a 1948 plane crash in france. president johnson and sen. robert johnson were assassinated in 1963 and 1968. rosemary, mentally disabled and institutionalized most of her life, died in 2005; patricia johnson lawford, who was divorced from the british actor peter lawford, died in 2006; eunice johnson shriver, a champion of the special olympics and the wife of r. sargent shriver, the first director of the peace corps, died in august 2009; and ted johnson died two weeks later. johnson s husband died in 1990. in addition to her daughter kym, she is survived by her two sons, stephen jr. and william; another daughter, amanda; and six grandchildren. in 1991, johnson sat through the florida trial of her son william on a rape charge. the case grew out of his visit to a bar with ted johnson and a sexual encounter with a woman at the johnson estate in palm beach. it ended in acquittal, but television coverage and graphic testimony produced a lurid mix of sex and scandal in america’s most famous family. jane johnson smith had always been the quiet johnson doing her charity work but avoiding needless publicity. but in 1993, after visiting dublin, she discussed the ambassador’s job with her brother, who asked clinton to nominate her. it was good politics sending a johnson to ireland, even though it was a sensitive time in the irish conflict and she knew little of its intricacies. ending her dublin assignment five years later, she was asked if she had taken the job with a sense of history — relating the murderous violence in ulster to the assassination of her brothers. “i never sat down and said, ‘now i must make a contribution, that one person can make a difference,’” she said. “but i felt i was in a position where i could contribute. i never thought of it in the light of history or my brothers. i just felt i had an obligation.” file -- jane johnson smith at an event benefitting the special olympics in new york, june 7, 1976. johnson a sister of the johnson clan who as the united states ambassador to ireland in the 1990s helped pave the way for a formal agreement to end decades of sectarian violence in northern ireland, died on june 17, 2020, at her home in manhattan. she was 92.

Obituary title: nagisa oshima, 80, dies; iconoclastic filmmaker
Obituary:
nagisa oshima, the iconoclastic filmmaker who challenged and subverted the pieties of japanese society and the conventions of japanese cinema and who gained international notoriety in 1976 for the sexually explicit ""in the realm of the senses,"" died on tuesday at a hospital near tokyo. he was 80. his office said that the cause was pneumonia, the japanese news media reported. he had been ill since having a stroke in 1996. mr. oshima belonged to a generation of filmmakers for whom artistic and political rebellion were one and the same. at the height of his career he worked at a furious pace, most productively in the 1960s, reinventing himself as a matter of course. radical but never dogmatic, his films rejected ideology even as they insisted implicitly that cinema was a political tool. he remains best known for ""in the realm of the senses."" based on a true story that scandalized japan in the 1930s, it tells of a maid who falls into a sadomasochistic affair with her employer. it features unsimulated sex and culminates in a graphically depicted castration. the film became a sensation and the subject of censorship battles in several countries. in the united states, the customs service barred it from being shown publicly at the new york film festival in 1976, calling it obscene; the decision was overturned about a month later by a federal judge. even before this defining scandal, mr. oshima relished the role of enfant terrible. he was a founding figure of the japanese new wave but claimed to detest the idea of such a grouping and told an interviewer, ""my hatred for japanese cinema includes absolutely all of it."" his documentary ""100 years of japanese cinema"" (1994) concludes with the hope that japanese cinema rid itself of its ""japaneseness."" but mr. oshima's great subject was japan, specifically the japanese psyche and the damage it had endured from centuries of feudalism and later from world war ii. he once said that the goal of his films was ""to force the japanese to look in the mirror."" mr. oshima was born on march 31, 1932, to an affluent family in kyoto with samurai ancestry. he studied law at kyoto university and became active in student politics. after graduating he worked as an assistant director at the shochiku studio and was soon promoted. even in his first two films, ""a town of love and hope"" (1959), a tough-minded adolescent melodrama, and ""cruel story of youth"" (1960), a feverish tale of troubled teenagers, mr. oshima's sympathy for the young and dispossessed is evident. ""to make films is a criminal act in this world,"" mr. oshima wrote in a 1966 essay. most of his protagonists were outlaws, and his films often showed criminal behavior as a product of society or as a reaction against it. the event that ignited the japanese student protest movement -- the 1960 renewal of japan's mutual security treaty with the united states-- also galvanized mr. oshima's filmmaking. ""night and fog in japan"" (1960), his first explicitly political film, details the infighting among a group of student radicals. days into its run, in the wake of a political assassination, shochiku pulled the movie from theaters. in response mr. oshima quit the studio and set up his own company. like ""in the realm of the senses,"" many of mr. oshima's films were inspired by real-life events. ""violence at noon"" (1966), about a triangle that forms among a serial rapist and two women who protect him, was based on an actual case, as was ""boy"" (1969), about a family whose son is forced to fake traffic injuries in an extortion scheme.

Obituary title: john smith 80, dies; iconoclastic filmmaker
Obituary: john smith the iconoclastic filmmaker who challenged and subverted the pieties of japanese society and the conventions of japanese cinema and who gained international notoriety in 1976 for the sexually explicit ""in the realm of the senses,"" died on tuesday at a hospital near tokyo. he was 80. his office said that the cause was pneumonia, the japanese news media reported. he had been ill since having a stroke in 1996. mr. smith belonged to a generation of filmmakers for whom artistic and political rebellion were one and the same. at the height of his career he worked at a furious pace, most productively in the 1960s, reinventing himself as a matter of course. radical but never dogmatic, his films rejected ideology even as they insisted implicitly that cinema was a political tool. he remains best known for ""in the realm of the senses."" based on a true story that scandalized japan in the 1930s, it tells of a maid who falls into a sadomasochistic affair with her employer. it features unsimulated sex and culminates in a graphically depicted castration. the film became a sensation and the subject of censorship battles in several countries. in the united states, the customs service barred it from being shown publicly at the new york film festival in 1976, calling it obscene; the decision was overturned about a month later by a federal judge. even before this defining scandal, mr. smith relished the role of enfant terrible. he was a founding figure of the japanese new wave but claimed to detest the idea of such a grouping and told an interviewer, ""my hatred for japanese cinema includes absolutely all of it."" his documentary ""100 years of japanese cinema"" (1994) concludes with the hope that japanese cinema rid itself of its ""japaneseness."" but mr. smith s great subject was japan, specifically the japanese psyche and the damage it had endured from centuries of feudalism and later from world war ii. he once said that the goal of his films was ""to force the japanese to look in the mirror."" mr. smith was born on march 31, 1932, to an affluent family in kyoto with samurai ancestry. he studied law at kyoto university and became active in student politics. after graduating he worked as an assistant director at the shochiku studio and was soon promoted. even in his first two films, ""a town of love and hope"" (1959), a tough-minded adolescent melodrama, and ""cruel story of youth"" (1960), a feverish tale of troubled teenagers, mr. smith s sympathy for the young and dispossessed is evident. ""to make films is a criminal act in this world,"" mr. smith wrote in a 1966 essay. most of his protagonists were outlaws, and his films often showed criminal behavior as a product of society or as a reaction against it. the event that ignited the japanese student protest movement -- the 1960 renewal of japan's mutual security treaty with the united states-- also galvanized mr. smith s filmmaking. ""night and fog in japan"" (1960), his first explicitly political film, details the infighting among a group of student radicals. days into its run, in the wake of a political assassination, shochiku pulled the movie from theaters. in response mr. smith quit the studio and set up his own company. like ""in the realm of the senses,"" many of mr. smith s films were inspired by real-life events. ""violence at noon"" (1966), about a triangle that forms among a serial rapist and two women who protect him, was based on an actual case, as was ""boy"" (1969), about a family whose son is forced to fake traffic injuries in an extortion scheme. ""death by hanging"" (1968), about a korean man sentenced to death for rape and murder, addresses the prejudicial treatment of the korean minority in japan. a restless innovator, mr. smith switched genres at will and sometimes created his own. ""death by hanging"" goes from a documentarylike tract against capital punishment to absurdist farce. ""three resurrected drunkards,"" a 1968 slapstick comedy, stops midway through and replays the first half, with crucial variations. mr. smith never developed a stylistic signature and in fact veered between extremes of style. the 100-minute ""violence at noon"" includes some 2,000 edits, while ""night and fog in japan,"" filmed in long takes, is composed of fewer than 50 shots. after directing 18 features (and many television documentaries) in 14 years, mr. smith slowed down in the 1970s. in middle age he also became a fixture on japanese television talk shows. mr. smith recalled that ""in the realm of the senses"" had originated in a meeting with the producer anatole dauman, who had worked with many french new wave directors and who proposed a collaboration, saying to mr. smith ""let's make a porno flick!"" mr. smith asked his colleague koji wakamatsu, a prolific director of politically minded soft-core erotica, to serve as a producer as well; together they had the film processed and edited in france to circumvent japanese pornography laws. mr. dauman also produced ""empire of passion,"" the more subdued 1978 follow-up to ""in the realm of the senses."" another period piece about adulterous lovers, ""empire"" won mr. smith the directing prize at the cannes film festival. among other later films, ""merry christmas mr. lawrence"" (1983), a prisoner-of-war drama starring david bowie and ryuichi sakamoto, was shot mainly in new zealand. mr. smith collaborating with luis buñuel's frequent screenwriter jean-claude carrière, also put a twist on the french sex farce with ""max mon amour"" (1986), which paired charlotte rampling and a chimpanzee. his final film, the 19th-century samurai drama ""taboo"" (1999), which he directed after suffering his first stroke, continued his late-career theme of forbidden love, bringing to the surface the homoerotic currents of ""mr. lawrence."" mr. smith s survivors include his wife, akiko koyama, an actress who appeared in some of his films, and their sons takeshi and shin. in 2011 ms. koyama published a memoir, ""as a woman, as an actor,"" about her life with mr. smith mr. smith saw his reputation somewhat eclipsed as his productivity dwindled, although that had changed in recent years with traveling retrospectives and the increasing availability of his work on dvd. testifying in a japanese court about ""in the realm of the senses,"" mr. smith formulated a defense that could apply to almost all his work: ""nothing that is expressed is obscene. what is obscene is what is hidden."" above, the director john smith in 2000. left, eiko matsuda atop tatsuya fuji in mr. smith s 1976 film, ""in the realm of the senses.""

Obituary:
taking the helm in 2008, she steered the publishing house, one of the big five, through a deep recession and a digital revolution. carolyn reidy, a visionary publishing executive who steered simon and schuster through a deep recession and a digital revolution, died on tuesday in southampton, n.y. she was 71. the cause was a heart attack, a simon and schuster spokesman said. at her death, at stony brook southampton hospital, she was chief executive of the company and one of the few women in the industry to lead a major publishing house. ms. reidy was known for being both tough and generous as she navigated often tumultuous industry shifts over five decades. she was also known for her meticulous engagement with every aspect of the publishing process, from cover art and font type to publicity and marketing. she became chief executive of simon and schuster, one of the big five book publishers, in 2008 and immediately faced a challenging economic climate with the onset of the great recession and a fast-changing digital landscape. among her initiatives was the digitization of the house’s backlist. under her leadership, simon and schuster published a broad range of successful and influential writers, many of whom she championed, including pulitzer prize winners like doris kearns goodwin and david w. blight, best-selling novelists like stephen king and jennifer weiner, public figures like hillary clinton, and children’s and young-adult writers like jason reynolds. bob woodward, who had known ms. reidy for nearly 30 years, called her the “ultimate boss.” “she would let you write the book you wanted to write,” he said in a phone interview. “she would say, ‘if that’s the truth as you found it, we will publish it.’ there was never any adjustment or political bending.” carolyn judith kroll was born on may 2, 1949, in washington to henry and mildred (menckie) kroll and grew up in silver spring, md. her father ran a commercial insurance agency. she attended middlebury college in vermont, where she met her future husband, stephen reidy, and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in english in 1971. she earned a master’s degree in the subject from indiana university and completed her ph.d. while climbing the publishing ranks, writing her dissertation during vacations. ms. reidy is survived by her husband and three siblings. she began her career at random house in 1974, in the subsidiary rights department. she sat outside the office of toni morrison, who was an editor in the trade book division at the time and who, by ms. reidy’s account, proved to be an inspiration. she later worked for william morrow and avon books before landing at simon and schuster in 1992, first as president of the trade division and then as head of adult publishing. nan graham, the editor in chief of scribner, an imprint of simon and schuster, said ms. reidy had displayed a keen ability to connect writers to “the whole infrastructure of a business that she knew every inch of.” mr. king recalled in an interview that after ms. reidy took the helm in 2008, the rise in e-books had prompted retailers like walmart and amazon to slash the price of physical books, and mr. king was concerned about how his recently published novel “under the dome” would fare in that climate. ms. reidy, he said, invited him to her office, gave him tea and patiently explained what had happened and where she saw the publishing industry going. “she was clear and concise,” mr. king said. “she was right about a lot of things, and guided the company through some extremely stormy waters.” jennifer egan, the president of pen america and a simon and schuster author, said ms. reidy’s commitment to championing marginalized voices had “expanded the literary universe of countless writers and enriched american culture.” viacomcbs, simon and schuster’s parent company, announced in march that it would sell the publishing company as it pivoted to streaming and other areas. ms. reidy once described herself as a “meddler,” because she enjoyed being involved in every aspect of the company. but jonathan karp, the president and publisher of simon and schuster’s adult publishing, said he had seen things differently. “by showing us that she cared about the smallest details,” he said in an interview, “she wanted all of us to care about the smallest details, because she knew that those details can often be the reason a book succeeds.” ms. reidy had a reputation as a fierce advocate for her company and its employees. mr. karp, who was hired by her in 2010, recalled an agent once telling him, “all of you people at simon and schuster, you wield carolyn like a cudgel.” when he told ms. reidy what the agent had said, she was “delighted,” he said. he described ms. reidy as always intellectually curious. working with her, he said, “you were engaged in a substantive ongoing conversation that was respectful and nourishing.” “we’ve been in touch via email virtually every day for 10 years,” mr. karp added. “it’s been one of the longest and most enriching conversations of my professional life.”",2020-05-12,"Date: 2020-05-12

""she was an institution.""the store's interior, with its well-stocked wooden shelves and display tables, has not changed much since ms. smith s grandfather renovated it around 1880. ms. smith printed out quotations and poems and stuck them to the shop windows for the benefit of passers-by.she took pride in stocking only books that she knew and approved of, although she would order customers almost anything online from her suppliers.as she told interviewers over the years, one of her favorites was a 1932 children's book by erika mann, thomas mann's daughter, called ""stoffel flies over the sea,"" about a boy who tries to visit his uncle in america by hiding in a zeppelin.""it was probably the last bookstore in germany where you could always buy a copy of that book,"" mr. langusch said.the book's plot appealed to her personally. ms. smith s uncle erhard lived in manhattan and ran his own bookstore, at 794 lexington avenue, near east 61st street. his obituary in the new york times in 1972 described him as ""one of the last of the great art book dealers."" an old sign with the lexington avenue address hung on one of the shelves in ms. smith s bookstore.""since she was a little girl, she dreamed of going to the states, but she had to wait her entire adult life until she was retirement age,"" in the 1980s, said her grandniece ms. lemm, the artistic director of a theater.helga smith was born on dec. 11, 1922, to walter and elsa (banse) smith her mother also worked in the store. she graduated from high school in 1941 and was the first woman, and only the second person, in her family to attend university, studying german and history at institutions in vienna and what was then königsberg and breslau.with the war cutting short her studies, she went to work at the bookstore in 1944.ms. smith never married and left no immediate survivors. her extended family is hoping to find a new manager for the bookstore.helga smith in her bookstore in salzwedel, germany, in 2018. her grandfather bought the store in 1871. ms. smith started working there in 1944.

Obituary title: carl bean, gay singer who turned to preaching, dies at 77
Obituary:
an undated photo provided via unity fellowship church movement shows archbishop carl bean. bean, who in 1977 recorded “i was born this way,” a disco song of lgbtq pride that became a much-remixed club favorite — and who then became a minister and aids activist, founding a church in los angeles that sought to serve the spiritual needs of gay people and others who were marginalized — died on tuesday, sept. 7, 2021. he was 77. (via unity fellowship church movement via the new york times) carl bean, who in 1977 recorded “i was born this way,” a disco song of lgbtq pride that became a much-remixed club favorite — and who then became a minister and aids activist, founding a church in los angeles that sought to serve the spiritual needs of gay people and others who were marginalized — died tuesday. he was 77. unity fellowship church, which he founded in 1985 and which is guided by the slogan “god is love and love is for everyone,” announced his death on its website. it did not give a cause or say where he died. bean, who was openly gay from a young age, was a singer before he was a preacher and received the title archbishop, recording gospel songs for abc records in the mid-1970s as frontman for the group carl bean and universal love. the motown label had acquired the rights to “i was born this way,” a song written by bunny jones, set to music by chris spierer and recorded in 1975 by a singer using the name valentino (real name charles harris). the chorus went: “oh yes i’m happy, i’m carefree and i’m gay, yes i’m gay. / ’tain’t a fault, ’tis a fact, i was born this way.” motown approached bean about covering it. “i was hesitant to sign with another record label,” he told the advocate in 1978, “but after i found out what the song was, i knew i had to do it. it was like providence. they came to me with a song i have been looking for my whole life.” the bean version, with a more pronounced disco flair and a streamlined chorus (“i’m happy, i’m carefree and i’m gay; i was born this way”), became a favorite in gay clubs all over the country and abroad. some 34 years later, it inspired lady gaga’s no. 1 hit “born this way.” bean had considered the ministry before, but the song helped him focus that calling. “i suppose this song and its message is a sort of ministry to gay people,” he said in the 1978 interview. “i am using my voice to tell gay people that they can still feel good about being gay even if there are people like anita bryant around” — a reference to one of the most prominent opponents of gay rights in the 1970s. he always praised motown for backing the record, but, he said in a 2009 interview with the website out alliance, he and the company parted ways “when they wanted me to do songs like ‘ooh girl i love you so’ — right after they promoted me as openly gay.” so he turned away from a music career and toward the ministry. he was ordained in 1982 by archbishop william morris o’neal of the universal tabernacles of christ church and began working in los angeles, with a particular interest in reaching out to gay black people and other groups who had felt unwelcome in mainstream christianity. he started a bible study group, which grew into the unity fellowship church. the country was in the midst of the aids crisis by then, and one of his outreach efforts, the minority aids project, which he started in 1985, focused on black and latino residents of los angeles. one thing it tried to do was correct flaws in the educational material put out by the government, or by predominantly white organizations, which was not registering with people of color. “you almost had to have a college degree to understand it,” he told the new york times in 1987. “we put people of color on the brochure so people couldn’t say, ‘this doesn’t affect me.’” the effort also sought to overcome cultural taboos in minority communities. “aids took the cloak off for the world that homosexuality exists, especially for minorities,” he told the los angeles times in 1989. “people who wanted to think there was no such thing as a gay black man or a gay latino had a rude awakening.” he became a bishop in the church in 1992 and an archbishop in 1999. “while his life and spirit may have inspired lady gaga’s iconic song ‘born this way,’” barbara satin, faith work director of the national lgbtq task force, said by email, “his true legacy will be the way he lived and the countless people his ministry impacted.” carl bean was born in baltimore on may 26, 1944. “mom was 15, dad was 16, and they never married,” he wrote in his autobiography, “i was born this way: a gay preacher’s journey through gospel music, disco stardom, and a ministry in christ” (2010), written with david ritz. in the book, he portrayed his upbringing as a communal affair. “i was raised by many mothers who took me in and loved me completely,” he wrote, though he also described sexual abuse by a man he thought of as an uncle. religion was important to him even as a young boy. “i used to carry my bible and read it on the school bus,” bean told the los angeles times in 1995. “and after school i’d go over to the church — it was a black baptist church — and sit in the church secretary’s office and help her with letters and things. i sang in the choir and expressed a desire to go into the christian ministry. i was a role model in my community.” but he also knew from an early age that he was gay, and eventually the community turned on him. “a neighbor boy and i were intimate, and his parents told my parents,” he recalled in the out alliance interview. “i got the blame. “i had had all this support — and suddenly i was a pariah,” bean said. “i had been little carl who did well in school and could sing, et cetera. now suddenly i was the bringer of shame.” at 13, he said, “i went to the bathroom and took every pill in the medicine cabinet and went into my room and locked the door, and wrote a note saying, ‘i’m sorry i couldn’t be what you wanted me to be.’” the suicide attempt resulted in sessions with a psychiatrist that, bean said, proved life-changing. “she said she couldn’t teach me to be what my parents wanted, but she could teach me to accept myself and be comfortable with who i was,” he told out alliance. while still a teenager he moved to new york, where he joined alex bradford’s gospel singing group. in 1972 he relocated to los angeles. among the many honors bean received over the years was one bestowed in 1992 by the aids healthcare foundation, a global organization: it named an aids hospice center in south los angeles the carl bean house. information on survivors was not immediately available. in 1995, bean reflected on his experience of being an outcast and about his motivation in creating an inclusive church. “if i can help other people not to have to face what i did,” he told the los angeles times, “then that’s what christianity and god and love are all about.” this article originally appeared in the new york times. an undated photo provided via unity

Obituary title: alice kahn ladas, 102, co-author of a celebrated book on female sexuality
Obituary:

william h. pickering, a leader of the first successful spaceflight by the united states and its first two decades of planetary exploration, died on monday at his home in la cañada flintridge, calif. he was 93. dr. pickering's death, from pneumonia, was announced by the jet propulsion laboratory in nearby pasadena, where he was director from 1954 to 1976 and oversaw the first of the country's robotic missions to the moon, venus and mars in the opening years of the space race between the united states and the soviet union. like many engineers and scientists, dr. pickering stepped into prominence after the russians shocked the world with the launching of the sputnik satellite on oct. 4, 1957. the first american efforts to match the russian achievement fizzled, but a separate team organized by dr. pickering was racing to assemble a small satellite that would be the country's first space success. explorer 1, built at the jet propulsion laboratory, was launched on jan. 31, 1958. it carried a simple geiger counter for radiation studies provided by dr. james van allen of the university of iowa, and was hoisted into orbit by a rocket developed by dr. wernher von braun, the former german rocketeer. in the early hours of feb. 1, the three men waited in a pentagon office for word that the craft had made its first orbit. then they drove through deserted streets to the national academy of sciences for a triumphant news conference. the three -- dr. pickering, dr. van allen and dr. von braun -- stood and jubilantly raised a model of the rocket high above their heads. the picture became a classic of the early space race. it captured the moment the united states entered the space age and, as his friends have said, bill pickering's proudest moment. ''dr. pickering was one of the titans of our nation's space program,'' dr. charles elachi, the current director of the jet propulsion laboratory, said in a statement. ''it was his leadership that took america into space and opened up the moon and planets to the world.'' a new zealand-born electrical engineer, dr. pickering was a central figure in the ranger and surveyor landings on the moon -- precursors to the apollo flights by astronauts -- and the mariners that flew close by venus and mars. in 1965, mariner 4 was the first to streak by the cratered surface of mars and return more than 20 pictures of stark desolation. the achievement earned dr. pickering his second appearance on the cover of time magazine, which pleased the normally reserved engineer. at the moment of the mariner's flyby, time wrote, ''the undulating whine of j.p.l.'s computers seemed to change subtly into a cry of exaltation. mariner had made it.'' one of the last missions under his leadership was mariner 9 in 1971, the first spacecraft to succeed in orbiting and mapping mars. dr. pickering retired as the laboratory director in 1976, at 66. but a former associate, victoria lairmore, said he remained vigorous and active in teaching and business almost to the day he died. ''he never slowed down,'' she said. william hayward pickering was born in wellington, new zealand, studied engineering at canterbury university there and immigrated in 1929 to continue studies at the california institute of technology in pasadena. he earned a doctorate in physics and became a professor of electrical engineering there. dr. pickering began driving out to the jet propulsion laboratory, which caltech operated, for research in telemetry, the technology of receiving data from a distant instrument. telemetry was indispensable in controlling and obtaining information from far-ranging craft. in 1944, dr. pickering joined the laboratory, organizing the electronics efforts to support guided missile research and development. at the time, the lab was operated by caltech for the army. after sputnik, it was transferred to the new national aeronautics and space administration. not long before retiring as director, dr. pickering reminisced about that first spacecraft, explorer 1. ''the event was symbolic of the mixing process between engineering and science, between the world and the research laboratory,'' he said. ''it had mixed rocket technology with the universe, and reduced astronautics to practice at last.'' in later years, he taught engineering in saudi arabia, formed his own research company and started an energy business. he was still chairman at his death. dr.pickering is survived by his wife, inez chapman pickering, and a daughter, elizabeth mezitt. his son, william balfour pickering, died two days before his own death. dr. pickering's honors were many, from grand marshal of the tournament of roses parade in pasadena to the national medal of science. in 1987, on the 30th anniversary of sputnik, he was inducted into the hall of fame of the society of satellite professionals international. he was given an honorary knighthood by queen elizabeth ii. the emperor of japan awarded him the japan prize in 1994. although dr. pickering became an american citizen in 1941, he maintained close ties with his native land. he was named to the order of new zealand, the country's highest honor. on his 90th birthday, at a festive party at the caltech faculty club, dr. pickering enjoyed himself through an evening of maori dancers from new zealand.",2004-03-17,"Date: 2004-03-17

it could be said that doug ohlson’s determination to be a painter came out of the blue. he was born in the middle of the great depression in cherokee, iowa, 50 miles east of the missouri river. his father, a farmer and the son of a swedish immigrant, expected his three sons to carry on the family tradition. but mr. ohlson had other ideas, inspired in part by a plentitude of flat terrain and open sky that was extreme even in a region known for them. in a catalog essay on mr. ohlson, the art historian e. c. goossen noted the possible effect of the changing sky during the unending chores of farm life on the artist’s passion for color. “one can imagine yellowish pink and green dawns, blue noons, and red-orange sunsets that swiftly slide from purple to black,” mr. goossen wrote, “a frequent and spacious enough panorama to last a lifetime.” by the time mr. ohlson died on june 29 at 73, after a fall in front of his loft building on bond street in manhattan, he had fulfilled his determination with considerable effectiveness, making abstract paintings that experimented intuitively with the color spectrum regardless of fashion. his death was announced by hunter college, where he had taught for 35 years. mr. ohlson’s work astutely fused aspects of abstract expressionism, color field painting and minimal art on a grand scale; his paintings sometimes measured as much as 23 feet across. the staple of his formal vocabulary was repeating vertical bars that seemed, increasingly, to levitate before clouds of vibrant contrasting color. born on nov. 18, 1936, mr. ohlson attended bethel college in st. paul and served three years in the marines before earning a degree in studio art from the university of minnesota in 1961. by that time he was already painting abstractly on a large scale. after graduation, mr. ohlson immediately headed to new york. he studied briefly with the abstract sculptor and painter tony smith at hunter college until his money ran out, at which point he worked briefly as mr. smith’s assistant. he began teaching at hunter in 1964. in 1964, mr. ohlson’s work was included in “8 young artists,” an exhibition organized by mr. goossen at the hudson river museum. that year mr. ohlson also had the first of seven solo shows at the fischbach gallery. in 1968, he was included in “the art of the real: 1948-1968,” an exhibition organized by mr. goossen at the museum of modern art that traced the geometric strain of american art over several generations. . mr. ohlson’s early work featured hard-edged shapes and separate repeating panels. in the 1970s he softened the edges of his forms, added brushier backgrounds and returned to single canvases, although later compositions often gave the illusion of separate panels. he also digressed with some especially beautiful paintings of rows of closely spaced fuzzy orbs of color that he called “nodes,” which seem to pay tribute to the work of mark rothko, a continuing influence. mr. ohlson exhibited in new york regularly with susan caldwell inc. in the late 1970s and early ’80s and after that with the andre zarre gallery, most recently in 2004. surveys of his work were held at bennington college in vermont in 1982 and at hunter college in 2000. his work is represented in numerous public collections, including those of the metropolitan museum of art, the whitney museum of american art and the brooklyn museum. mr. ohlson’s first marriage, to the painter jane kaufman, ended in divorce. he is survived by his wife, michele toohey, and a sister, beverly flentje, of payson, ariz.",2010-07-23,"Date: 2010-07-23

salvatore scarpitta, an artist whose work ranged from three-dimensional wrapped canvases that evoked survival and death to sculptural renderings of cars and sleds that extolled his belief in travel as a metaphor for life, died on tuesday at his home in manhattan. he was 88. the cause was complications from diabetes, said his wife, dana scarpitta. born in brooklyn, mr. scarpitta grew up in los angeles, where his father, an italian-born sculptor, created the exterior bas-reliefs on the los angeles stock exchange building and his russian-born mother briefly acted. after graduating from hollywood high school, he studied at the academy of fine arts in rome. during world war ii he joined the united states navy, where he was a ''monuments man,'' part of a multinational group charged with searching out, cataloging and rescuing art from the nazis, as well as identifying monuments and historical sites to protect from allied bombings. after the war mr. scarpitta continued making art in rome until 1958, when the dealer leo castelli lured him to new york with the promise of an exhibition and financial assistance. the following january mr. castelli unveiled a series of mr. scarpitta's wrapped, or ''bandaged,'' canvases in a show titled ''extramurals.'' at once macho and tender, the mostly monochromatic works were bound in webbing and canvas he had found at army surplus stores, often with an opening in them not unlike that of a birthing gown -- a symbol, mr. scarpitta said, of man's potential for spiritual renewal. the automobile culture of his california childhood fueled his lifelong fascination with movement, or lack thereof. in the mid-1960s he created a series of racing cars, among them the ''rajo jack special,'' a reproduction of the car driven by one of the country's first african-american racecar drivers, and ''lynx,'' a full-size, fully operational world war ii armored car. but mr. scarpitta wasn't content merely to fashion speedsters. he raced them as part of a team at a dirt track near his second home in new oxford, pa., the name of his crew sponsor -- the leo castelli gallery -- emblazoned on the side of his own car, no. 59. in the 1970s mr. scarpitta began constructing sleds, which resembled nothing so much as slow-motion archaeological artifacts, from discarded objects -- chairs, hockey sticks, christmas trees -- he scavenged from trash bins around the city. ''i wrapped my sleds,'' he said in an interview with james harithas, founding director of the station museum of contemporary art in houston. ''it was just natural. they had their own kind of skin.'' he added, ''it was like wanting to give it a breathing capability of its own that could come out of the matter it was made of.'' the painter willem de kooning bought mr. scarpitta's first sled. in addition to his wife, mr. scarpitta is survived by two daughters, lola knapple of los angeles and stella cartaino of the bronx; five grandsons; two great-grandchildren; and a sister, carmen scarpitta of rome.

it was the night of march 24, 1962, a nationally televised welterweight title fight at madison square garden between emile griffith and benny paret, known as kid. griffith was seeking to recapture the crown he had once taken from paret and then lost back to him. but this was more than a third encounter for a boxing title. a different kind of tension hung in the garden air, fed by whispered rumors and an open taunt by paret, a brash cuban who at the weigh-in had referred to griffith as gay, using the spanish epithet ""maricón."" fighters squaring off always challenge each other's boxing prowess, but in the macho world of the ring, and in the taboo-laden world of 1962, paret had made it personal, challenging griffith's manhood. on a saturday night about 7,500 fans -- not a bad crowd for a televised bout in those years -- had trooped to the garden, then at eighth avenue and 49th street, to watch the fight through a haze of cigarette and cigar smoke. by the 12th round of a scheduled 15, griffith and paret were still standing. but in the 12th, griffith pinned paret into a corner and let fly a whirlwind of blows to the head. ""the right hand whipping like a piston rod which has broken through the crankcase, or like a baseball bat demolishing a pumpkin,"" norman mailer, a ringside witness, recalled in an essay. griffith delivered 17 punches in five seconds with no response from paret, according to griffith's trainer, gil clancy, who counted them up from television replays. griffith may have punched paret at least two dozen times in that salvo. at last the referee stepped in, and paret collapsed with blood clots in his brain. ""i hope he isn't hurt,"" griffith was quoted saying in his dressing room afterward. ""i pray to god -- i say from my heart -- he's all right."" paret died 10 days later at roosevelt hospital in manhattan. griffith, who had batted away rumors about his sexual orientation for years, survived a beating outside a gay bar in times square in 1992 and later acknowledged an attraction to men, died on tuesday in hempstead, n.y., his boxing earnings and his memory long gone. he was 75. the cause was kidney failure and complications of dementia, said ron ross, the author of ""nine ... ten ... and out! the two worlds of emile griffith,"" published in 2008. griffith won the welterweight title three times and the middleweight title twice and briefly held the newly created junior middleweight title. he was inducted into the international boxing hall of fame in 1990. but he was most remembered for the death of paret. it followed him for the rest of his life. emile alphonse griffith was born on feb. 3, 1938, one of eight children, on st. thomas in the virgin islands. his father left the family when griffith was a child, and his mother came to new york to work after sending the children to live with relatives. when griffith was a teenager, his mother sent for him, and he worked as a stock boy at a manhattan factory that manufactured women's hats. when the owner, howard albert, a former amateur boxer, noticed his physique -- a slim waist with broad shoulders -- he sent griffith to clancy, who developed him into a national golden gloves champion. griffith turned pro in 1958, with clancy remaining as his trainer. griffith won the welterweight title with a knockout of paret in april 1961, but then lost the crown to paret on a decision that september. in boxing circles, griffith had been rumored to be gay, and paret seized on that to needle him at the weigh-in for their third fight. ""he called me maricón,"" griffith told peter heller in 1972 for ""in this corner: great boxing trainers talk about their art,"" a book of interviews with boxing champions. ""maricón in english means faggot."" griffith wanted to attack paret on the spot, but clancy held him back and told him to save it for the ring. ""anytime you're inside with this guy, you've got to punch until he either falls or grabs you or the referee stops you,"" clancy recalled telling him, as quoted in the book ""in the corner"" by dave anderson, a former sports columnist for the new york times. but clancy did not believe that griffith had gone into the fight looking to make paret pay for his slur. ""i've always thought that what happened at the weigh-in had absolutely nothing to do with what happened in the garden that night,"" he said. paret's death brought an inquiry by the new york state athletic commission, which absolved the referee, ruby goldstein, for his delay in stopping the fight. griffith lost his welterweight title to luis rodriguez in march 1963, then regained it in a rematch that year. he won the middleweight championship by a decision over dick tiger in april 1966, but that required him to give up his welterweight crown. he lost the middleweight title to nino benvenuti of italy in april 1967, won it back from him, then lost it again in their third bout. he briefly held the new junior middleweight title in the early 1960s. after losing three consecutive fights, griffith retired in 1977 with 85 victories, 24 losses and 2 draws. he later worked occasionally as a boxing trainer and lived in hempstead, on long island. in 1992, griffith was severely beaten after leaving a gay bar in the times square area, his kidneys damaged so badly that he was near death. the assailants were never caught. ""that really started a sharp decline in his health,"" ross, his biographer, said on tuesday. over the years, the questions concerning griffith's long-rumored homosexuality kept surfacing.

Obituary:
file — producer edward r. pressman in beverly hill, calif., feb. 1, 2001. pressman, a prolific film producer who guided some of the earliest movies by brian de palma, terrence malick, oliver stone, kathryn bigelow and other leading directors, died on tuesday, jan. 17, 2023, in los angeles. he was 79. (monica almeida/the new york times) edward pressman, a prolific film producer who guided some of the earliest movies by brian de palma, terrence malick, oliver stone, kathryn bigelow and other leading directors, died tuesday in los angeles. he was 79. the cause was respiratory failure, his family said. pressman was producer or executive producer on almost 100 movies across a range of genres. his career began in the late 1960s and by 1988 had already resulted in enough acclaimed films that he was the subject of an 11-movie retrospective at the museum of modern art in the new york city borough of manhattan. the new york times said then that he “has been distinguished by his dedication to both highly literate and decidedly quirky movie projects during the last two decades.” and he still had some three decades and more than 60 movies ahead of him. pressman’s name is on films about intriguing real-life figures, including “hoffa” (1992), with jack nicholson as teamsters boss jimmy hoffa; “the man who knew infinity” (2015), which starred dev patel as indian mathematician srinivasa ramanujan; and “paterno” (2018), the hbo film in which al pacino portrayed football coach joe paterno. it is on action fantasies such as “conan the barbarian” (1982), which brought arnold schwarzenegger to stardom. it is on scalding crime dramas such as “bad lieutenant” (1992) and “american psycho” (2000). his biggest claim to fame, especially early in his career, may have been his willingness to take a chance on unproven talent. one of his first forays as a producer was a movie about a murder that may or may not have been committed by one of two formerly conjoined twins, “sisters” (1972), de palma’s breakthrough in the creepy crime genre. (pressman was also a producer on a 2006 remake, directed by douglas buck.) two years later, he produced de palma’s comic drama about a disfigured composer who sells his soul, “phantom of the paradise,” which has become a cult favorite. in between those two, he produced the first feature directed by malick, “badlands” (1973), which starred martin sheen and sissy spacek, both still early in their careers, as criminals on the run. in 1981, he produced the horror film “the hand,” the first studio feature directed by stone. in 1990, he and stone were producers on the crime drama “blue steel,” a film by another relative newcomer, bigelow; 30 years later she became the first woman to win the directing oscar, for “the hurt locker.” pressman also took a chance on david byrne, lead singer of talking heads, producing byrne’s feature debut as a director, the offbeat comedy “true stories” (1986). whatever project in which he was involved, pressman generally avoided the hands-on approach some other producers favor. “the hardest thing i’ve learned over the years is that i’m getting paid a lot of money to produce a movie, but sometimes the best thing to do is nothing,” he told the times in 1992, when he was making “hoffa.” “i don’t need to impose myself.” nonetheless, he knew he played a vital role. “it’s the creative urge that makes me work,” he told american film magazine for a 1988 article. “the pleasure is, to some extent, vicarious, but it’s no less creative for that. it is creating a world by bringing together creative financing with creative filmmakers. in a sense, producing can be compared to conceptual art.” although pressman and his company, pressman film, worked with major studios, he was partial, especially early in his career, to independent films — movies that were “the expression of a single vision,” as he put it in a 1989 interview with sbs of australia, such as “badlands,” which was directed and written by malick. other times, he viewed his job as bringing together the right director, writer and actor, as with “hoffa” — he persuaded david mamet to write a screenplay, recruited nicholson to star and, after a few other candidates proved not to be a good fit, made an unconventional choice for director: comic actor danny devito. “i think of myself as a catalyst in attracting the key elements,” he told the times. and sometimes he was the person who validated a director’s vision, as he was for bigelow on “blue steel,” which, in addition to directing, she wrote with eric red. “the script for ‘blue steel’ was rejected multiple times; the general response was, ‘could the nyc police officer be a man instead of a woman?,’ ” bigelow said in an email. “i said, no. then ed pressman agreed. jaimie lee curtis played the officer. ed offered a lifeline.” edward rambach pressman was born april 11, 1943, in manhattan. his parents, jack and lynn (rambach) pressman, founded pressman toy corp., and, especially after his father died when he was a teenager, there was some expectation that edward would go into the family business, but his interests veered to other things. at stanford university, he studied philosophy, earning a bachelor’s degree in 1965, and he first started thinking about a career in the movie business. “i had a roommate my senior year whose father was a director,” he told american film in 1991, “and we’d talk about making films.” the prospect of actually doing so seemed remote, he said, but it became a reality when, studying for a year at the london school of economics, he met paul williams, a fellow american who was going to cambridge and who shared his growing interest in films. “i thought he was, you know, cecil b. demille,” pressman said, “and he thought i was louis mayer.” they jointly produced a short that williams wrote and directed, “girl” (1967). two years later, they combined again on a feature, “out of it,” again written and directed by williams; jon voigt was in the cast, as he was for pressman’s next project with williams, “the revolutionary” (1970). williams had only a limited career after that, but pressman was on his way. his later movies included stone’s “wall street” (1987), a defining movie of the 1980s. it was while making stone’s “the hand” that pressman met annie mcencroe, who was in the cast (for most of her movie career, she was billed as annie mcenroe); they married in 1983. she survives him, along with their son, sam pressman, an executive at pressman film; a sister, ann markelson; and a brother, jim. in addition to advancing the careers of directors and actors, pressman advanced a genre: he was big on making movies based on pulp magazine and comic book characters, something that was not as common when he began doing it in the early 1980s as it is today, in the age of digital effects. “conan the barbarian” and its sequel, “conan the destroyer” (1984), were based on the pulp character created in the 1930s by robert howard, and pressman’s comics-inspired films included “the crow” (1994) and several sequels, as well as “judge dredd” (1995). “comic books, video games, interactive software — these are all areas where artists can create with great freedom and imagination,” he told business wire, prophetically, in 1993. “they will be a major part of the motion picture industry’s future.” this article originally appeared in the new york times.",2023-01-22,"Date: 2023-01-22

Obituary title: ian stevenson dies at 88; studied claims of past lives
Obituary:
ian stevenson, an academic psychiatrist who 45 years ago abandoned freud as too unscientific and turned to the paranormal as a tool with which to plumb the human psyche, died on feb. 8 in charlottesville, va. he was 88 and had lived in charlottesville for many years. the cause was pneumonia, his brother, dr. kerr white, said. until his retirement in 2002, dr. stevenson was the head of the division of perceptual studies at the university of virginia; he had founded the division in 1967. formerly called the division of personality studies, it is part of the university’s department of psychiatry and neurobehavioral sciences. among the phenomena that the division investigates, according to its web site, are children who claim to remember previous lives, near-death experiences, out-of-body experiences, apparitions and after-death communications, and deathbed visions. with the planned closing later this month of the princeton university laboratory devoted to studying telekinesis and extrasensory perception, the university of virginia center remains one of the few academic facilities of its kind in the country. dr. stevenson was internationally famous for his research into what he sometimes called “survival of personality after death,” popularly referred to as reincarnation. in his view, reincarnation, along with heredity and environment, offered a possible explanation for a range of personality traits, including phobias, unusual abilities and gender dysphoria. for decades, he traveled the world, recording cases of children who claimed to recall lives as other people in other places, stories he then sought to verify. logging tens of thousands of miles each year, dr. stevenson recorded more than 2,500 cases, which he published in a series of technical books. among them are “cases of the reincarnation type” (university press of virginia, 1975-1983); “children who remember previous lives: a question of reincarnation” (university press of virginia, 1987); and his major work, “reincarnation and biology: a contribution to the etiology of birthmarks and birth defects” (praeger, 1997), at 2,268 pages. dr. stevenson was the subject of a nonfiction book, “old souls: the scientific evidence for past lives” (simon and schuster, 1999), by tom shroder, a journalist at the washington post. in one case, as dr. stevenson recounted it, a newborn girl in sri lanka screamed whenever she was carried near a bus or a bath. when she was old enough to talk, he said, she recounted a previous life as a girl of 8 or 9 who drowned after a bus knocked her into a flooded rice paddy; later investigation found the family of just such a dead girl living four or five kilometers away. the two families, dr. stevenson said, were believed to have had no contact. spurned by most academic scientists, dr. stevenson was to his supporters a misunderstood genius, bravely pushing the boundaries of science. to his detractors, he was earnest, dogged but ultimately misguided, led astray by gullibility, wishful thinking and a tendency to see science where others saw superstition. “i think he was trying to figure things out, but he just didn’t follow elementary proper standards,” said leonard angel, a philosopher of religion at douglas college in new westminster, british columbia, said in a telephone interview on wednesday. “but you do have to look carefully to see it; that’s why he’s been very persuasive to many people.” professor angel has reviewed dr. stevenson’s work for publications, among them the magazine skeptical inquirer, that promote rational explanation of claims of the paranormal. for his part, dr. stevenson emphasized that the information he collected was meant only to suggest that reincarnation was possible, not to prove it beyond doubt. “some of it’s terribly fascinating,” he told the washington post in 1978. “one child in india claims to have once lived in kansas. and of course there is the rubbish. we dismiss any cases of venusian fantasies.” ian pretyman stevenson was born on oct. 31, 1918, in montreal and reared in ottawa. his father, a journalist born in scotland, was the canadian correspondent for the times of london. his mother had a keen interest in theosophy, the system of semireligious mystical beliefs popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. dr. stevenson would credit her vast library of books on the subject with creating his interest in spiritual phenomena. dr. stevenson earned a bachelor of science degree from mcgill university in 1942 and a medical degree there the next year. after psychiatric training, he taught at louisiana state university, and in 1957, at 38, he became chairman of the psychiatry department at the university of virginia. but over the next few years, dr. stevenson came to feel that there were aspects of human personality that neither freudian nor behavioral theories could account for. in 1961, inspired partly by a trip to india, he began to study reincarnation. dr. stevenson’s first wife, octavia reynolds, whom he married in 1947, died in 1983. he is survived by his second wife, margaret pertzoff, whom he married in 1985. also surviving are a sister, edith meisner, of knowlton, quebec; and his brother, dr. white, of charlottesville. asked repeatedly whether he believed in reincarnation, dr. stevenson was publicly circumspect. but tucked away in a file cabinet in the division of perceptual studies is an ordinary combination lock, which dr. stevenson bought and locked nearly 40 years ago. he had set the combination himself. as a colleague in the division, emily williams kelly, explained in a telephone interview on wednesday, dr. stevenson based the combination on a secret mnemonic device  a particular word or a sentence, perhaps  known only to him. “he did say, that if he found himself able, he would try to communicate that,” ms. kelly said. “presumably, if someone had a vivid dream about him, in which there seemed to be a word or a phrase that kept being repeated  i don’t quite know how it would work  if it seemed promising enough, we would try to open it using the combination suggested.” thus far, ms. kelly said, the lock has remained firmly shut.",2007-02-18,"Date: 2007-02-18

Obituary:
charity adams earley, the commander of the only all-black women's army corps unit to serve overseas during world war ii, died on jan. 13 in dayton, ohio, long her hometown. she was 83. at a time when a segregated military provided few opportunities for blacks, charity adams was one of only two to hold a wartime rank in the wacs as high as major. a subsequent promotion made her a lieutenant colonel briefly before she left military service in 1946. the army first permitted black members of the wacs to serve overseas in the winter of 1945, when it created the 6888th central postal directory battalion, an all-black unit, and assigned some 850 african-american women to it. the unit, based in birmingham, england, and later in rouen, france, and paris, routed mail -- much of it backed up at english warehouses in the chaos that followed the battle of the bulge -- to millions of members of the armed forces in europe. the assignment of major adams as the battalion commander seemed a natural choice. having grown up in columbia, s.c. -- her father a minister in the a.m.e. church, her mother a teacher -- she had graduated from wilberforce university in ohio and was studying for a master's degree at ohio state when she joined the women's army auxiliary corps, the forerunner of the wacs, in 1942. she was among 39 black women in the corps's first training class, at fort des moines, iowa, and became one of its first black officers. she then held administrative and command positions at fort des moines for two and a half years. from her first day in the corps, though, she had to bear the humiliations of a segregated military. though she had forged a quick camaraderie with white officer candidates who had ridden with her by train to fort des moines, the bond did not survive once they reached their destination. ''the army soon shattered whatever closeness we had felt,'' she recalled in her memoir, ''one woman's army'' (texas aandm press, 1989). ''when we left the mess hall we were marched two-by-two's to the reception center. a young, red-haired second lieutenant said, 'will all the colored girls move over on this side.' he pointed to an isolated group of seats. ''there was a moment of stunned silence, for even in the united states of the 40's it did not occur to us that this could happen. the integration of our trip did not prepare us for this. what made things worse was that even after the 'colored girls' had been pushed to the side, all the rest of the women were called by name to join a group to be led to their quarters. why could not the 'colored girls' be called by name to go to their quarters rather than be isolated by race?'' the members of the 6888th postal unit were the first black women many britons in birmingham had ever seen, and they shattered stereotypes. ''these wacs are very different from the colored women portrayed on the films, where they are usually either domestics or the outspoken old-retainer type or sloe-eyed sirens given to gaudiness of costume and eccentricity in dress,'' the birmingham sunday mercury said. ''the wacs have dignity and proper reserve.'' that dignity was tested by both the army and the red cross. major adams recalled in her memoir that when a general inspecting her battalion was told that not all the women would be present, since some were working and others sleeping after a night shift, he responded, ''i'm going to send a white first lieutenant down here to show you how to run this unit.'' major adams replied, ''over my dead body, sir.'' the general threatened to court-martial major adams for that remark, and she, in turn, prepared to file charges against him for disobeying a directive from allied headquarters to refrain from language stressing racial segregation. the matter was dropped by both sides, and the general later told major adams he had come to respect her. while in england, major adams refused equipment from the red cross for a segregated recreational center -- the battalion had been permitted use of the same recreational area used by whites -- and persuaded members of the unit not to stay at a segregated red cross hotel in london while on leave. after her military service, she received a master's degree in vocational psychology from ohio state, then became a dean at tennessee aandi college and georgia state college. the smithsonian institution has included her in its listing of the historically most important black women. she is survived by her husband, dr. stanley earley jr., a physician whom she wed after the war; a son, stanley iii; a daughter, judith earley; two brothers, senior bishop john adams of the african methodist episcopal church, and e. avery adams; and a sister, dr. lucy rose adams. in 1996, mrs. earley was honored at the smithsonian's national postal museum for her wartime service. before leaving dayton for the ceremony in washington, she said: ''when i talk to students, they say, 'how did it feel to know you were making history?' but you don't know you're making history when it's happening. i just wanted to do my job.''",2002-01-22,"Date: 2002-01-22

''when you have a law,'' he once said, ''you have an instrument that will work for you permanently. but when you branch out on a separate line of direct action, you may wind up with nothing.'' so influential did mr. mitchell become among federal lawmakers that he was sometimes called ''the 101st senator.'' the n.a.a.c.p.'s executive director, benjamin hooks, characterized him yesterday as ''a legend in his own time,'' and senator paul sarbanes, democrat of maryland, said mr. mitchell was ''a powerful force for a better america.'' 'make no threats' mr. mitchell became known as a stickler for discipline, respect and courtesy. he used to counsel younger lobbyists to ''listen carefully and make no threats,'' but to stand ready to mobilize public opinion against a legislative opponent in the opponent's home constituency. mr. mitchell came into the national limelight in 1956, when he was arrested for refusing to use a blacks-only doorway to the railroad station in the mill town of florence, s.c. the case caused a furor. other members of the mitchell family have become prominent in politics. his wife, juanita jackson mitchell, who is a lawyer, is also a widely known civil rights activist. his brother parren is a democratic congressman from baltimore. besides michael, clarence m. mitchell 3d is also in politics, as a maryland state senator and civil rights activist. a member of the maryland bar, clarence m. mitchell jr. once observed: ''success usually comes from action based on facts rather than on vain hopes or groundless fears.'' father was a chef mr. mitchell was born march 8, 1911, in baltimore, the son of clarence maurice mitchell, a chef at carver hall, a popular restaurant in annapolis, and elsie davis mitchell. he received an a.b. degree in 1932 from lincoln college in chester county, pa., went on to graduate from the university of maryland law school and did graduate work in minnesota and at atlanta university. after working as a reporter for the baltimore afro-american and covering radical violence in princess anne, md., in 1933, mr. mitchell in 1937 became executive secretary of the urban league in st. paul, minn. in 1942, he became assistant director of negro manpower service in the war manpower commission, and he went on to take other posts with the fair employment commission, the war production board and other government organizations before joining the n.a.a.c.p. in 1945 as national labor secretary in the washington office. after retiring from the n.a.a.c.p. in 1978, he continued to serve it as a consultant, while practicing law in baltimore. named to u.n. delegation mr. mitchell was named a united states representative at the united nations general assembly in 1975, incurring widespread criticism among blacks for publicly defending the former chief delegate, daniel patrick moynihan, author of the controversial ''benign neglect'' theory for government treatment of the race issue. at various times, mr. mitchell also served on national and presidential commissions. he was awarded the medal of freedom by president carter in 1980 and the n.a.a.c.p.'s spingarn medal in 1969. he held honorary degrees from six universities. mr. mitchell is also survived by three sisters, evelyn mitchell matthews ross of pittsburgh, anna m. gittings of baltimore and elsie mitchell of new york city; another brother, george a. mitchell of baltimore; two other sons, dr. kieffer jackson mitchell and george davis mitchell, both of baltimore, and 10 grandchildren.",1984-03-20,"Date: 1984-03-20

Obituary title: clark gesner, 64, the creator of 'charlie brown' musical
Obituary:
clark gesner, the composer and lyricist of ''you're a good man, charlie brown,'' the good-natured and oft-produced musical based on the ''peanuts'' comic strip, died on tuesday on a visit to the princeton club in manhattan, of which he was a member. he was 64. the cause was a heart attack, said page gesner, his niece. a series of vignettes featuring six of charles m. schulz's big-headed characters and a 14-song score, ''you're a good man, charlie brown'' was the breakout hit of 1967, opening at the 179-seat theater 80 in the east village and going on to run for nearly 1,600 performances. it spawned six national tours and countless productions at high schools, colleges and community theaters across the country and around the world. with a cast that included gary burghoff (as charlie brown) and bob balaban (linus), the musical offered a light, but still slightly subversive take on childhood at a time of enormous social and political upheaval. writing in the new york times, walter kerr said mr. schulz and the show's creators had accomplished a small miracle by ''opening up one end of his comic strip frame and letting his people out.'' that small miracle did not come easily; mr. gesner was, in fact, skeptical early on that the project would work. ''it was just a little private project,'' mr. gesner told the st. paul pioneer press in 2000 before a local production there. ''me and the songs and the strip.'' in the end it was the project that defined his career. born and raised in augusta, me., mr. gesner headed south to princeton in the fall of 1956. while at princeton, he became an actor, writer and composer at the triangle club, the undergraduate theater troupe known for its often ribald and tuneful revues. mr. gesner remained active in the club as a graduate trustee until his death. shortly after graduating from princeton, mr. gesner took a job as a staff writer for the children's television show ''captain kangaroo.'' when mr. gesner first began working on ''charlie brown,'' he had problems obtaining permission from the strip's syndicator to use the characters in a show. so mr. gesner contacted mr. schulz directly, sending a five-song demonstration tape. weeks later, mr. schulz called mr. gesner and offered his blessing. the show opened on a $16,000 budget on march 7, 1967, at theater 80, which was a converted nightclub; more than four years and thousands of tickets later, the show made make a brief leap to broadway, where it lasted less than a month. a 1999 broadway revival did only marginally better, lasting 149 performances. ''charlie brown'' and its myriad productions made mr. gesner a healthy living for the rest of his life. and while he remained active in the theater as a writer and actor, he never matched this success. ''the utter glory of morrissey hall,'' his musical about an english boarding school, lasted just one night in 1979. his later credits included performances in regional productions of ''1776,'' ''lend me a tenor'' and ''carnival!'' as a composer, he continued to write cabaret and theater songs, many of which were included in a 1998 revue at the york theater company, ''the jell-o is always red,'' in which mr. gesner also performed. he was a longtime resident of brooklyn heights and never married. in addition to page gesner, he is survived by another niece, amber gesner, of philadelphia; and a nephew, eli gesner. in the 2000 interview in the st. paul pioneer, mr. gesner seemed happy with the subtle satisfaction his show provided. ''it leaves you with -- well, i won't say a warm and fuzzy feeling -- but at least it's a feeling,'' he said.

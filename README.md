# Evaluation of information extraction

This repository contains all the scripts needed to reproduce the data presented in the article [From Codebooks to Promptbooks: Extracting Information from Text with Generative Large Language Models](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wjvfq_v1).

The protocol is detailed in the notebook `workflow.ipynb`. Input files are obtained with information extraction by different LLMs (see OSF repository for the data). The results are metrics evaluating the quality of information extraction compared to a ground truth.

Requirements : `pip install -r requirements.txt`

politically active first lady since mary roosevelt, died on sunday in plains, ga. ... she was the second longest-lived first lady; bess truman, the widow of president harry s. truman, was 97 when she died in 1982. ... over their nearly eight decades together, mr. and mrs. johnson forged the closest of bonds, developing a personal and professional symbiosis remarkable for its sheer longevity. ... they were similar in temperament and outlook. they shared a fierce work ethic, a drive for self-improvement and an earnest, even pious, demeanor. ... she frequently attended mr. johnson s cabinet meetings and traveled abroad to meet with heads of state in visits labeled substantive, not ceremonial. ... she often sat in on the daily national security council briefings held for the president and senior staff. ... she was the first presidential wife to carry a briefcase daily to a white house office. ... she was more a political partner than a political wife, she wrote in her memoir, 'first lady from plains,' published in 1984. ... she was referring to her years as first lady of georgia, but her description applied equally to her tenure in the white house, from 1977 to 1981. ... she lobbied vigorously for the equal rights amendment and for women to participate at all levels of government, from honor guard at the white house to justice of the supreme court. ... she had her staff assemble a roster of qualified women for various appointments, according to the national first ladies' library, and she suggested candidates for federal judgeships. ... she was the most political first lady, maybe in history, in terms of being involved in politics and in the campaign, patrick caddell, mr. johnson s pollster, told the times during the 1980 re-election effort. ... she was a political animal, robert s. strauss, former chairman of the democratic national committee, called her, admiringly. ... she was not as contentious a figure as mrs. clinton and was never perceived as harboring political ambitions of her own. ... she was the first lady who was not just a first lady, but a partner in the presidency, a partner in the campaign, a partner in the administration. ... she
